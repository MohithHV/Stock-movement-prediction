SMCI loose analysis and opportunity simmering SMCI golden age and beautiful chart After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team We just saw in the last month of 72 rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around 48 the last critical level we saw was 49 Also it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming My half baked technical analysis is We will see a minor pull back around 50 to finish the pattern then it will launch back up to the next critical level around 60 a share Fundamentally speaking they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors especially their trademark marked water cooled rack which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 219 the earnings per share is a humble 2 the ps ratio is 15 which is the lowest among its competitors In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD which is 11 There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more I was going to buy on the next red day expecting it to be Monday but I digress Next pull back Im buying calls with a strike price of about 4955 exp in March Even considering a YOLO God Speed to the investors and traders,6,14,1733620054.0

MSTR Achilles Heel The streets do not like MSTR This is not an opinion And ETF is the way to kill the beast EDIT MSTR IS NOT BTC NEW ETF DOES NOT MEAN MSTR GO UP BTC GO UP ETF GO UP BUT MSTR STAY STAGNATE WHY Because there is more opportunity at cheaper valuations elsewhere for the same exposure to BTC AND MUCH safer then MSTR Insititons do not own and will not own MSTR at these levels without a strong hedge 2030 for institution is enough for them to call it a day since they control billions in client money and having different goals then you an I You are waiting for hundreds of percentage gains over leveraged without a hedge They need a few percentages with a hedge and they pull the rug The launch of Bitcoin ETFs which would allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without owning it directly has already shifted the flow of capital away from individual assets like MicroStrategy to these ETFs This already lowered the demand for MicroStrategy stock which is seen as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure The crazy part Hundreds of ETF are due to launch within 3060 days Sailor is purchasing as much BTC as possible so that he is able to justify MSTR being more expensive then BTC He is doing so before its too late when the inflow comes in into ETFS This is apparent in his aggressive purchasing every time he purchase and BTC went up he becomes closer to trying to get MSTR to the value of BTC Very hard to do and now nearly impossible Historical Example During the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s speculative capital flowed into individual tech stocks but when ETFs like the NASDAQ100 became popular investors moved into the ETF shifting capital away from individual companies Similarly when financial instruments like the SPDR SP 500 ETF SPY became widely adopted it drew capital away from individual stocks in favor of more diversified portfolios Volume and Liquidity Bitcoin ETFs would allow for larger more fluid trading compared to MicroStrategys relatively lowvolume stock In 2023 the average daily trading volume of Bitcoinrelated stocks like MicroStrategy was in the hundreds of millions In contrast Bitcoin ETFs could see daily volumes in the billions of dollars further attracting capital from microcap stocks Correlation between Bitcoin and MicroStrategy Over the last three years the correlation coefficient between MicroStrategys stock and Bitcoins price has ranged from 08 to 09 on a scale from 1 to 1 This indicates a nearperfect correlationinvestors in MicroStrategy are essentially betting on Bitcoins price trajectory Once Bitcoin ETFs increase in market presence this direct correlation may weaken causing MicroStrategys stock to lose its status as a Bitcoin proxy,0,38,1733614423.0

28k HIMS Feb 21 25 26P Started building my position last week when HIMS broke above 31 Not going to add any more Ive been watching HIMS for awhile and made about 15k on this most recent run up Decided to switch to puts because think HIMS is due for a pullback at least a shortterm one Euphoria is pumping the stock price to unbelievable levels The thing about euphoria is that one little bit of negative news sends shares flying down like a couple weeks ago when it was announced that amazon is entering the telehealth space as a direct competitor Shares down 25 in a day or two Even if we are on the way up I believe a return to the mean is likely to occur in the next 4060 days Could be wrong but buying calls at 34 seems more risky than puts What do you guys think,20,15,1733558187.0
My thesis on INTC going into 2025 I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025 Disclaimer I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of 2930 I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed Most of the AI revolution has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead Intel is competing with TSMC and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 79B which was even reduced from the US government On top of that the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies 66B to TSMC to build in the US So really the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do instead of subsidies This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing while TSMC can manufacture in the US CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US in either Malaysia or Taiwan and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs In the chip design space Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia and now Apple Amazon OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture Intel still dominates the CPU space but your average datacenter rack might have 1020 GPUs for each CPU AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs and as such takes about 25 of the market Intels only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market which mainly targets budget gaming crypto mining and cheap datacenter The newest release of the Battlemage B580 is expected to compete with Nvidias 4060 at the under 300 MSRP market which are lofty goals Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now Its clear that on the design front Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful While this is their core business and majority of revenue it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering However the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90 of the worlds sub 5nm chips was a bad idea That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government This is so that the country keeps its Silicon Shield the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China But Intel has no such limitation And TSMC is not able to fufill 100 of the orders for its customers it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI This demand exists for Intel to take part of So Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry not Products side of the business This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest which I suspect is keeping them from customers The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry which is what the US wants I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs it could become the US TSMC Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm which is the current cutting edge But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration and so they will work towards this goal To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025 If you got this far thank you for reading EDIT Now that I think about it it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intels Products division I think they expressed as much earlier this year but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit,106,117,1733555831.0
Airline tickets are like options contracts if you really think about it Are they tradable joke btw I just came to an interesting realization today as I was making my vacation plans I checked the price of some tickets online after checking them last week only to find they increased in price This reminded me of options I mean think about it You buy a ticket option contract with an airline like a stock with a destination strike price or whatever for a date in the future expiration date If you buy right before a major holiday earnings season your ticket will increase in value leading up to it IV effect and if you chose not to fly not to exercise your ticket becomes worthless IVTheta crush And sometimes you can fly on standby that is called placing a market order The only difference is that there are major liquidity issues limited amount of seats and leaps dont usually cost that much Buckle up regards this is the DD of a lifetime Imagine if we built an exchange on this Positions 2x AAL 1223 ORDIAH 231,68,47,1733550699.0
CVNA puts for next week Alright regards let me preface this by saying NO ONE SHOULD DO THIS This is a dumb idea and I will likely lose I bought puts on CVNA at close on Friday If you want to see my past plays check my profile I called the MRNA bounce the NVDA sell off the NKE bounce but the UPST one was a bit offstill think itll happen Why would i do something so dumb Because I like spotting trend reversals as theyre happening On the daily chart you can clearly see the trend line break today The MACD is turning over the RSI is dropping even though were still near the short term top and that is a very convincing red candle on the daily On the 30 minute you can see the aggressive break more clearly but more importantly to me is the fact that the 50 day and 100 day EMAs have crossed to the downside for the first time since August 30 That is fucking crazy that it took that long for that to happen IMO that is a very bearish signal that I am not going to ignore Im not going to go into CVNAs financials or practices or the fact that they inflate their GPPU There are SO many DDs about how its overvalued and a scam company Everyone knows that but it just continues its stupid melt up That is until next week Im hoping other traders see this and decide to start sellingshorting this bitch into oblivion They probably wont tho and my contracts will expire worthless but well see One thing to note CVNAs delinquencies are at 126 and rising Their partner Ally financial warn in September that their delinquencies on auto loans was 20 bps higher than expected Thats significant Allys stock took a hit for that but CVNA didnt because CVNA is not on the hook for the trash loans they sell to Ally However Ally can increase their underwriting standards and make it harder for CVNA to give loans to every regard with a pulse Honestly this smells a lot like mortgages in 2008 Eventually this will blow up its just a matter of when And Im not saying itll blow up this week I just like the technical setup In closing this is stupid and no one should do this But I like a challenge and I like being right I only have 3 240 puts so far I may get more Monday Its not a big bet at all but i want some skin in the game so I can say Im right if it plays out how I think it will Not financial advice and do not tail me unless youre ok with losing what you put in,125,152,1733546121.0

On the Santa Claus rally At the end of the year there is a phenomenon in the stock market called the Santa Claus rally where the market as a whole rises into the new year Now if you were someone who had been making big money this year youd want to wait until next year so that you dont have to claim these gains on your taxes As it happens this has been one of the best years for the market as a whole and for certain stocks in general you know who you are So theres plenty reason to wait until next year to delay having to give the man the gains So just because things are going well now dont be surprised if we see a liquidation in late JanuaryFebruary,11,22,1733538812.0

AI applications double giant I think the double giant should be AppLovin and Palantir their recent performance in the US stock market is really very eyecatching it Especially AppLovin its share price and market value growth have exceeded market expectations is lovingly referred to as Wall Streets new favorite AI AppLovins success is largely due to its continued investment and innovation in AI technology such as the AXON 20 AIdriven technology used in the AppDiscovery platform which has dramatically increased advertisers spending and advertising realization rates Palantir its specific business from defense to healthcare from energy to finance Palantirs solutions can flexibly adapt to the needs of a variety of industries and AppLovin and called the twin giants the strength of the strength must not be underestimated Both companies are driving the US stock AI application sector higher and higher but also bring great inspiration to other companies telling us that AI technology is indeed the future trend,6,12,1733510321.0

Correction on my recent palantir short thesis A few weeks ago I made a detailed post about how Palantir is ridiculously overvalued and the final boss of stock market bubbles Since then the stock went up 25 in about 13 trading sessions adding roughly 40B of enterprise value The EVsales multiple expanded from 51x revenue to 64x revenue Excluding interest gained on cash the company now trades at 450x operating income Many companies experience this only when their earnings are swinging wildly from year to year but palantir really just is this expensive By buying a share of Palantir now you have the privilege of laying claim to a whopping 119 in revenue and 016 of operating income on a 76 share price Needless to say I got absolutely hosed on my short position So I will take my L and get back in my bear cave Thus I retract all of my statements and condense my newly formed sentiment to this Palantir is the greatest stock of all time Position 40000 3SPA 032 average,377,140,1733507605.0

STLA Mid Term Play Never thought I would be pushing this company as a good play but still makes sense STLA CEO was just canned because he was an imbecile who thought cutting everything could turn around a company The stock is cheap options are super cheap and while they can always go down another 9999 this one is still making tons of money It is just about the biggest bargain on the market PE is roughly 3 now and forward PE is like 37 they have valuable brands like Jeep and Dodge Once they appoint a new CEO this should jump significantly and bonus points if they arent euro trash I picked up a tiny play on Monday after seeing the news and that the stock was down as a result Up 70 so far It will take a bit for a new CEO search but that is why halfleaps are a great play not out of the question for this to climb back to the 20s by that time,10,20,1733502052.0
Lululemon jumps more than 18 beats Q3 earnings and raises Q4 guidance LULU was up more than 18 in todays session touching 40916 a new high since March of this year According to the latest earnings report Lululemons thirdquarter revenue reached 24 billion exceeding my expectation of 236 billion and above the companys previous forecast of a range of 234 billion to 237 billion The revenue growth was significant compared to the 22 billion reported in the same period last year In addition earnings per share EPS came in at 287 beating the markets estimate of 275 and up from 253 in the same period last year The company expects fourthquarter revenue to be in the range of 348 billion to 351 billion slightly below the markets estimate of 35 billion and expects EPS to be in the range of 556 to 564 below my estimate of 570 For investors holding Lululemon it is recommended to maintain a holding attitude and continue to focus on its longterm growth potential For new investors considering entry they can wait for further stock price adjustment in the near term and consider a gradual layout if the price retraces to more attractive levels Overall however Lululemon remains a quality growth stock that deserves longterm attention,52,25,1733501300.0

As an european do you buy only from EU stock market IBIS I was wondering if Europeans living in Europe should always invest in European stock markets Does it get any benefits by doing so Or is it better to invest in US markets like NYSE and NASDAQ due to greater volume and liquidity I wonder if that will come with extra tax and paper work I noticed in IBKR the commissions in Euro markets are around 125 while for US only 025 it makes a lot of difference so I was wondering how bad can it be to invest in NASDAQ instead of IBIS Is there anything I should know Like extra tax fees etc Thank you D,0,11,1733535738.0

What would you consider a good entry point for bitcoin Bitcoin recently hit a value of 100k as Im sure we are all aware by now Arguably bitcoin has been one of the most successful investments over the last 10 years up there with NVDA and other Mag 7 stocks I wont lie Ive been a Bitcoin hater for most of my investing career Its tough to conceptualize fully it has not always been mainstream enough so its understandable to be leery of it and its supporters are so ardent and ravenous that it feels like a cult I dont blame any skeptics for not putting their money into it That said over the last year or two it has certainly gained a ton of legitimacy as it has played a significant role in Trumps presidential campaign and also begun to be an asset that hedge funds are also purchasing I like many others I assume want to make it a part of my portfolio but its tough to analyze its value because it doesnt act like your usually security exchanged on the stock market There are no balance sheets or income statements for bitcoin to look at and I have no idea if its valuation is way too high or too low I can certainly see it continuing to go up in the near to mid term future If you told me it would hit 200k in the next two years I wouldnt be surprised That said I also wouldnt be surprised if it also hit 40k in the next two years too Is now a good time to buy Theres a lot of hype around it after it just hit 100k in value so Im nervous about jumping into it right now but Im struggling to put together a fair value estimate that I should wait for it to hit before I buy What are your thoughts on this matter,0,91,1733503867.0

A short critique of Ray Dalio Ray Dalio has done an absolutely amazing job with Bridgewater Associates kudos to him However I find that his viewpoints and his analyses especially when it comes to China are highly biased and to an extent nonsensical Dalio has historically been a strong proponent of China emphasizing its potential to surpass the US in economic dominance and advocating for the yuan taking the place of the USD as the next reserve currency He held these views as recently as 35 years ago but it feels like his stance has now moderated given what has happened in the last couple of years Dalios earlier optimism about Chinas trajectory was grounded in its rapid economic growth infrastructure development and increasing global influence Even at that time several experts pointed out that he was underestimating structural issues such as Chinas aging population mounting debt and a slowing economy something that he didnt seem to pay much heed to as he continued to toot the China horn Chinas demographic crisis with its shrinking workforce and rapidly aging population has significantly impacted its longterm growth prospects Geopolitical tensions regulatory crackdowns on industries and a cooling real estate market have further dampened investor sentiment Which Dalio can finally see quite late for an expert I feel Recently Dalio has changed his tune almost ackowledging his mistake as he referred to Chinas situation as more challenging than Japan in 1990 The arrogance he once had seems to have disappeared as he now emphasizes the need for caution and diversification reflecting a shift from his earlier unqualified enthusiasm to a more nuanced perspective,13,8,1733321449.0

SPHY Junk Bond ETF Question How Stable is it and what are potential risks What is the downside of high dividend Junk Bond ETFs such as SPHY I realize Junk Bonds involve higher risk so thats why theres a higher dividend yield and I realize there is a risk of default on some of the bonds in their portfolio But as the entire ETF wouldnt seemingly default in the event one or more bonds were to default whats the overall downside risk andor what am I not understanding Im not understanding how this fund is considered high risk given that it doesnt seem like the fund overall has any high degree risk of tanking completely into default Could the entire fund default and if so do you have any examples where this has happened to similar bond fundsin the past In other words if you look at the Overall History of SPHY as a fund it hasnt defaulted at any time and while there have been small price fluctations looking at the overall price history I dont see such a dramatic decrease in value that would cause me to think it is a super risky investment especially given that it pays a relatively high yield overall and that yield has only been increasing over time so far as I can tell By way of background I already have a diversified portfolio all index funds some HYSA and assets Im comfortable less than 10 years from retirement definitely considered a conservative investor overall and am not looking to take on significant risk Ive been thinking of parking for me a relatively small amount of my bond allocation in a junk bond ETF to take advantage of that higher yield Am I overthinking this andor what am I not understanding if anything please,0,2,1733260532.0

Anyone else buying the NU dip Ive been an investor in NU for a while now I firmly believe the market is panic selling because Warren Buffet sold 19 of his stake in the company Today the company is down again because Citi bank downgraded its rating on NU to a sell Why do people care that Citi bank downgraded to a sell Its literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets Citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing amazing company If anything the downgrade should be seen as a good sign It shows that american banks like Citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast NU has been able to expand its user base I know Brazil has made changes to its financial regulations However NU is rapidly expanding its user base to other countries Plus Brazils projected annual GDP growth per year is very good Do you guys agree EDIT Thanks for all your thoughts Ive realized there are a few key things I overlooked I previously thought the stock was heavily owned by retail investors similar to SoFis stock I naively assumed this because the stock is frequently discussed on social media Due to this preconceived notion I believed the stock price would be significantly influenced by analyst ratings I still think a large number of people have started to sell because of Warren Buffett reducing his stake and Citis sell recommendation However I now see that the primary factors driving this downturn are geopolitical and economic risks in Brazil My updated assessment is that the stock is being sold for a few very valid reasons Firstly Brazils inflation has been rising over the past few quarters Secondly Donald Trump has threatened BRICS nations with 100 tariffs if they decide to create a currency to rival the US dollar Thirdly Warren Buffett sold 19 of his stake in the company Fourthly the value of Brazils currency has been declining and recently hit historic lows compared to the US dollar Finally Brazils government spending was recently cut potentially signaling a slowdown in their economy Overall people are very concerned about the economic and geopolitical risks surrounding NU especially since it is a Brazilian company Brazil has a historically unstable economy and is currently facing economic headwinds that are amplified by the risk of potential tariffs Im taking a cautious approach from here on out I wont be selling any shares but I also wont be buying more until the stock price consolidates and the Brazilian economy stabilizes Im still very bullish on NU because the company has grown unbelievably fast in just 11 years They survived Brazils economic collapse in 20142016 and they also weathered the last round of US tariffs on Brazil in 2018 I believe NU will continue to expand rapidly into other Latin American countries which will reduce its exposure to Brazilian tariffs and economic challenges The CEO and management team are extremely competent and I believe in their ability to navigate these challenges in the long term The worstcase scenario would be if the BRICS nations successfully create a new currency Even then I still believe NU will be okay due to its expansion into other markets For now Im holding and remain very bullish on the business,6,34,1733151801.0

3 Months of Gains Lets go Almost 6 months ago I mutually agreed to part ways with my company I was President of a Construction Company that was private equity backed and based in Milwaukee A fun opportunity and different environment compared to being a serial entrepreneur Had the opportunity to service hundreds of customers and build a brand at the expense of someone else Definitely a cool chapter of my life Unfortunately my old man was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer on January 1 2024 Happy new year I guess right He currently lives in India and I split time between Milwaukee and Philadelphia Without getting into the weeds I resigned and relocated to India and travel back and forth every 3 months for a couple of weeks I decided over the summer that I would begin full time trading I have been passively investing in the market for the past 10 years more active since the beginning of the pandemic I have taught friends made and then lost and then recovered and made again Ive been in and out of the market but I decided to apply my approach at scale As an investor Im a believer in fundamentals but also a big value investor Being a serial entrepreneur and having scaled a variety of businesses in global markets I have found that I have a deep understanding of valuation and valueprospects I believe I have a similar approach and understanding to various MMs and have used that approach intertwined with technical to read the market My goal was to first generate enough monthly income to cover all liabilities I have on the books approx 78k per month in fixed expenses I have multiple accounts where I trade options exclusively but I decided I would set up a new account purely for trading of equities only I told my Old Man there were 251 trading days in a typical year if I could average 1 per day I would be able to generate 251 return LOL ambitious I know I did a little math looked at my trading history and formulated a pricing strategy for entry and exit in various ticker symbols where I have done a lot of due diligence Its funnyI found there are some names that I can never win on and there are some names that I can just continue to win with all mental I know but I know the price levels realy well Not every trade is a win and youll see that but I use my losses as ticket symbols to attack on swing trades and recover my losses over the course of the upcoming year I created an account in Robinhood with 36000 opening balance on September 3rd 2024 I average about 13000 in margin I transfer any profits when I close a position and the equity balance is greater than 36000 Here are my results I completed the first 3 months as of today with a 9226 return Robinhoods percentages are all messed up because its counts the withdrawals as capital reduction versus capital gains I hope I can keep this up going forward Wish me luck regards Update Added images Dont know why they didnt post the first time,0,11,1732911570.0
Is the market blind to the tsunami that will hit the US economy once Trump takes office Ive been reading and listening to a lot of comments from Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswami about their plans to slash government spending as well as RFKs plans to overhaul the pharma and food industries Since many of the agencies theyre looking at report directly to the Executive branch it seems likely that they and Trump will be able to realign or even abolish those agencies without too much trouble Assuming they are able to push through massive cuts to the federal government including possibly hundreds of thousands of layoffs among federal employees and contractors how will the markets react Up because of the lowered deficits or down due to all the uncertainty,0,35,1732903868.0

Thoughts on buying BRKBinstead of SP this month Does anyone have any thoughts on buying BRBK this month as a one off instead of the usual DCA into SP 500 I usually allocate the same amount of money to SP 500 every month and have done this for years However given much the stock market is up 27 YTD especially including the recent trump mania I think we are due a pull back And the way Buffet has been selling stocks recently so does he However would spending the same amount this month on Berkshire Hathaway stock instead of SP as a one off hedge against this risk WB has the highest stock pile hes ever had whilst still in the market albeit much smaller I was just thinking it as a way of further diversification Ill obviously keep all of my investments in the SP but as a one off for this month was thinking it could be wise to load up on BH stock so can receive the benefits of the business of interest from their cash holdings as well as their equity holdings Do you guys think this is a reasonable thought process or just stick to the plan and keep DCAing into the SP this month Thanks,17,26,1732891933.0

AI evolution has been exaggerated Snowflake shares rallied after releasing strong Q3 earnings but I think its AI progress is overstated Despite beating revenue expectations Q4 guidance is for only 23 growth and AI product revenue remains small and limitedRPO growth is largely coming from longterm contracts with large clients and future growth potential is unclear In addition Snowflakes valuation is already high much higher than peers such as Databricks which is growing faster Overall despite the AI hype driving the stock rally the companys actual growth is at risk of slowing down and I think we should be wary of possible overvaluation,58,44,1732738913.0
Assaults Coverups Ruined Reputation and a 51 Stock Drop Any Chance For Wynn Resorts So here is the full story of one of the biggest stock drops of WYNN though they havent recovered till this day Also anyone here with WYNN Whats your thoughts about it First things first Steve Wynn the companys founder was key to its brand and success as they positioned it But then in January 2018 the Wall Street Journal revealed sexual misconduct allegations against him backed by over 150 interviews These allegations some dating back decades led to investigations by Nevada and Massachusetts regulators Both found Wynn guilty and uncovered a coverup by senior executives what a shocker right The result was a staggering 55M in fines for the company After that the market reaction was fast WYNN stock plunged 18 in just days triggering a lawsuit from investors They accused the company of hiding Wynns misconduct and exposing them to financial risk Now after years of legal battles Wynn Resorts has agreed to pay a 70M settlement So if you owned shares during this time you might be eligible to submit a claim While the company has taken steps to rebuild its reputation like securing a UAE gaming license reducing debt and launching a 1B share buyback program WYNN still trades at 93 down 51 from its 2018 peak of 192 And has anyone here been affected by this How much were your losses if so,3,1,1732735234.0
What caused the major sell down across major world indices in early August Hey everyone I have recently started diving into world indices and looking more closely at the trends in global markets One thing that caught my attention was the significant selloff in early August 2023 that affected major indices across the globe From what I have gathered there were a number of factors at play but I am curious to hear your thoughts on what really drove the market downturn Was it mostly due to economic data like inflation bond yields geopolitical tensions or something else I have been reading about the impact of US inflation rising bond yields and concerns over Chinas economic slowdown but I would love to hear from others who have more experience with this What do you think caused this major selloff and how did it affect different global indices Looking forward to hearing your insights,3,4,1732661582.0

How are smaller companies having such a bad 12 years lately but big companies are booming How are smaller companies in good fields taking such a hit over the last 12 years but big companies continue to boom Im no expert but that just seems crazy and so inorganic I get that the companys themselves arent doing well or might have a bad financial year but down 90 or more in a year or two just doesnt really make sense to me For it to drop like that it obviously means people are selling but in order for those sales to go through that means people are still buying the stock so somebody still believes in the company And like they could have a bad year where revenue is down 25 or more than previous years so how does that justify a 90 drop Or maybe theyre running low on cash and really the only way to raise cash to help their situation is issuing shares or a reverse split or whatever If cash on hand is their biggest problem wouldnt making the stock price go up help the company and then lead to more growth Granted cashonhand is probably hardly the biggest factors in these drops but just trying to grow my knowledge I thought the stock market kinda went handinhand in a sense that when big companies are growing the little ones also follow kinda like in 20202021 now it seems to be the opposite I guess is that just the difference between big companies and small ones When hard times come the big ones are able to adjust and recover and the smaller ones just get destroyed And to finish it off how do you tell the difference between companies that have no hope and will most likely be bankrupt soon versus those that will most likely make a comeback and recover from being down 90 or more I feel like it could be a great time to put a little bit of money in these smaller companies but dont really know how to tell if theyre gonna last or not Mods please dont remove I took out the example companies I listed Im just trying to gain knowledge and here some expert answers,22,31,1732658615.0

Energy Fuels UUUU DD Overview Energy Fuels together with its subsidiaries engages in the extraction recovery recycling exploration permitting evaluation and sale of uranium mineral properties in the United States The company produces and sells vanadium pentoxide rare earth elements and heavy mineral sands such as ilmenite rutile zircon and monazite Explanation of Element and Mineral Importance Uranium This is the fuel for nuclear reactors Please see my post on Uranium if you want to understand the significance of it and why Energy Fuels will massively benefit from it Link Here Vanadium is a key component in vanadium redox flow batteries VRFBs which are used for energy storage systems Due to shifts toward renewable energy sources the demand for efficient largescale energy storage is increasing VRFBs are particularly suited for grid storage due to their scalability long lifespan and ability to discharge over a long period making vanadium an essential material for the emerging clean energy economy This shift represents a significant growth driver for the vanadium market as energy storage technologies become increasingly vital SWOT on VRFBs Guidehouse Insights The nuclear energy sector represents a significant opportunity for vanadium products Vanadium alloys are highly valuable due to their low neutronabsorption characteristics and high temperature and corrosion resistance These properties make vanadiumbased alloys ideal for use in nuclear reactors particularly in the construction of pressure vessels and structural components The ability of vanadium alloys to withstand the harsh operating environments inside a nuclear reactor without significant degradation extends the service life of these components enhancing the overall safety and efficiency of nuclear power plants Vanadium is also used in the aerospace industry and plays a huge role in the steel industry as well due to its ability to enhance the strength and durability of steel Rare Earth Elements REEs NdPr A combination of two rare earth elements Neodymium Nd and Praseodymium Pr These elements are both crucial in the production of highstrength permanent magnets Their powerful magnetic properties are essential in Electric vehicles wind turbines consumer electronics and defense technologies Energy Fuels is one of the few US companies able to commercialize the production of separated NdPr Growth Projection for REEs in Energy Transition Source Adamas Intelligence NdFeB Magnets and Why They Are Important NeodymiumIronBoron Magnets are a type of permanent magnet They are the strongest commercially available magnet offering high magnetic strength while being lightweight and compact With the energy transition going on demand for these magnets is increasing significantly YoY Demand for NdFeB Magnets Worldwide From 20182022 NdFeB Magnet Content As we can see in the chart NdPr accounts for about a third of NdFeB magnets composition Heavy Mineral Sands Ilmenite Mined and processed to produce titanium oxide TiO2 TiO2 is used in paints coatings and plastics which allows UUUU to diversify their revenue further into industrial areas Zircon Used for manufacturing ceramics refractory materials and foundry molds Also used in the medical industry for things like dental and orthopedic implants and for PET imaging which is used for cancer diagnostics Rutile Similar to ilmenite rutile has a superior quality of titanium content making it more valuable Monazite A rare mineral that contains rareearth elements and uranium Used as a feedstock by Energy Fuels in their processing endeavors NdPr is extracted from Monazite as well as the minerals mentioned above White Mesa Mill 100 owned by Energy Fuels is the only facility in the USA able to process Monazite to produce REEs The only fully licensed and operating conventional uranium mill in the US Completed Phase 1 REE facility with up to 1000 tonnes of separated NdPr production capacity Largest producer of Vanadium in the US Production on standby currently due to low prices strong inventory on hand Price History YTD Return 320 1 Year Return 1763 5 Year Return 24455 Since 2007 9615 Average revenue growth for the last 3 years has been 196 The negative EBITDA is not something to worry about Mining sites are not easy to develop and require a lot of funding Although once these mines are up and running heavy mineral sands mining is low cost They are continuing to focus on creating revenue generating assets The company has essentially zero debt and very few liabilities with assets that doubled from 2020 to 2023 In the next year I believe we will see positive EBITDA due to mines becoming operational instead of sitting idle Q3 2024 Highlights Very good balance sheet with over 180 million of liquidity and no debt Uranium prices continue to drive revenue Sold 50000 pounds of U3O8 at spot price of 80 Proceeds totaling 4 million gross profit margin of 54 New longterm uranium contract Expected delivery of 270000330000 pounds between 2026 and 2027 Produced 38 tonnes of separated NdPr at White Mesa Mill NdPr produced at White Mesa is currently being qualified with permanent magnet manufactures and other potential customers setting the stage for growth Strong uranium inventory consisting of 235000 pounds finished U3O8 805000 pounds of U3O8 in ore and raw materials Expects inventory to continue increasing due to mining operations A large vanadium inventory of 905000 pounds finished V2O5 Acquisition of RadTran LLC On August 19th 2024 Energy Fuels announced it acquired RadTran a private company specializing in the separation of critical radioisotopes Since 2021 Energy Fuels and RadTran have been working together to evaluate the feasibility of recovering radium226 and radium228 from uranium processing at White Mesa Mill These recovered isotopes would be made available to the pharmaceutical industry and others to enable the production of acintium225 and lead212 These isotopes are critical components in the development of targeted alpha therapies which offer promising new treatments for various cancers There is currently a global shortage of Ra226 and Ra228 therefore limiting the supply of Ac225 and Pb212 This is a huge acquisition for Energy Fuels as medical isotopes possess immense demand Acquisition of Base Resources On October 2nd 2024 Energy Fuels announced the completion of its acquisition of Base Resources This is expected to transform the company into a global leader in critical mineral production including titanium zirconium REEs and uranium This is huge for the company as they brought in world class management and operations capability while gaining ownership over the Toliara Project in Madagascar This is widely considered by industry experts to be one of the best HMS heavy mineral sands projects in the world Conclusion I think this is a company with massive potential to be a large player in the supply chain for Vanadium and REEs With a stockpile of 905000 pounds of V2O5 they are easily able to capitalize on growing demand They are also in a great position to capitalize on the growing domestic market for uranium as we continuously rely less on foreign nations With 235000 pounds of inventory on hand and a production capability of 1114 million pounds of U3O8 per year the company will be able to profit from further spot sales and longterm contracts With strategic acquisitions of Base Resources and RadTran the company clearly demonstrates commitment to growth and innovation At a current price of 690 I believe within 2 years this company will triple in price to around 20,11,5,1732638398.0

Did anyone see what happened to quantum computing stocks this week I was browsing stocks on Robinhood last week and ran a saved search that I always use down daily 20 stocks and I saw QUBT and QBTS on there and I started doing some research on them Recently I have decided to move to long term positions and I have been very bullish on space stocks like LUNR and RKLB I genuinely feel like space will be the fastest growing sector over the next decade Anyway I went home that night watched a few videos on some cool stuff in quantum computing and said screw it I think Im long on quantum computing It seriously will change our world dramatically when we inevitably figure it out So I thought it was a deal dumped a few grand into QUBT QBTS RGTI and IONQ Apparently I just had amazing timing because this past week has apparently been great for quantum Researchers have figured out an important milestone in controlling qubits and Amazon announced that they were investing 4B into their own quantum computer DWave Quantum QBTS cracked a standardized encryption on a binary computer a few days ago too Theres been some big steps in the right direction on quantum lately Anyway theyve all increased almost 100 since then but Im going to hold I think its going to change the world exponentially and it may be sooner than we think,140,76,1732587976.0

How are Price Targets calculated How accurate are they There are a couple stocks that Im following that have extremely high price targets for the next 12 months Various places online are saying that they expect them to raise more than 1200 How is this calculated How accurate are these predictions I use a stock alarm so I dont miss when a stock skyrockets or a pump and dump And I understand that these are penny stocks and theres added risk But why arent more people investing in stocks like that How can they possibly predict that the stock will raise more than 1000 Are people just more comfortable with investing in a stock that could give them 5 back in a year more than the possibility of increasing by 1000 New to all of this so I appreciate the feedback,4,6,1732550886.0

Google on the run or Google on the run Can we talk about google for a second Everyone keeps touting it as a good deal right now assuming that Google will always rebound But 90 or so of Googles income comes from their search business which is slowly dying As a digital native Ive worked a lot with Googles products and Ive used google like everyone else to an extent where it is part of my everyday life But now Not so much I have to admit Im finding myself searching very rarely Yeah Im using maps and gmail and so on but the moat on those businesses is not very high My gut as their core consumer is telling me that I dont need google as much as I used to And honestly for the first time every where Ive actively reflected on it I totally can imagine a world without google So Im not so sure we are going back to an all dominant Google again and instead of assuming that Google will be the mastodont forever I can more rationally imagine a scenario where the business slowly adapts into niches over time Think Kodak etc What are all yalls take on this Thanks for your time,0,13,1732520221.0

Bitcoin Investor VS Bitcoin Investor The wealth transfer of bitcoin investors only occurs with others who also invest in bitcoin It has zero effect on people who dont buy into bitcoin at all It is Akin to watching a poker game from the outside it wont effect you the least bit if one person or the other wins the pot Essentially Bitcoin investors can only eat themselves This is ironic as all the posts within their Bitcoin circles act like they are in it together when it in fact the only people they are competing with is other Bitcoin investors Then you can add on top of this fact that a small minority roughly 5 own something close to 90 of all the bitcoins which they purchased for pennies,0,10,1733633026.0
Gold vs property vs BTCCrypto Contextbrief personal background Im about 30 bought a new house have been investing in stocks pay into a 401k pension and a small savings account make almost 100k annually and have no inheritance or trusts or any type of money coming from family previously and probably little to none in inheritance Im trying to continue diversifying my portfolio to safely retire and give my children flexibility in their futures which has lead me to contemplate my next move hence the title Property I own property currently I understand that historically property is probably the safesthighest yielding investment and even passive income option I worry long term not necessarily my lifetime but maybe my childrens that if natural resources in this case property became scarce that the governmentbanks could easily squeeze middle class people like myself out of our property via property taxes andor interest rates making it maybe a low probability of volatility but very possible Short term investments in property such as rentals arent a consideration for the sake of this conversation 1 because Im simply opposed to the idea and its implications but 2 because to reiterate Im trying to plan deep into the future for my children with the consideration exponential wealth disparity and natural resource scarcity Bitcoin BTC fundamentally seems ridiculous to me Im not arguing that people can have and will continue to profit off BTC You cant argue realized gains but it has no intrinsic value You could create any finite medium and people do with other crypto currencies all the time but like any fiat currency its only useful if a governmentany body of powerauthoritarian is backing it and 2 has the power to mandateenforce it Why would they switch from useless paper to useless software Why is bitcoin more valuable than an NFT or any other limited piece digital media that cant be duplicated It seems like a blatant pyramid scheme and Im genuinely baffled its taken so seriously by so many Gold is kind of where Im leaning It is finite it has intrinsic value longest historical value and I personally feel this is a genuinely one of the most effective ways to insulate yourself from hyper predatory capitalist Middle class people attempting to hoard property as an investment directly hurts other middle and lower class people because it limits supply and increases demand of a vital resource Not only is property needed for shelter but its also peoples biggest chunk of savings towards their inevitable retirement when they can downsize into a place that can comfortably die Investing in gold on the other hand only impedes industrialists and still yields personal gains Summary in this thought experiment assume we know in 50100 years we have the wealth disparity akin to feudalism the technology of tomorrow and a monopoly of all natural resources what do you invest in now I know my bias is clear I promise Im not here to troll people insult your intelligence or critique your morality If you have polar opposite feelings and investments as me I still very much want to hear your opinion on why Im wrong or what Im missing All I want is to protect my kids from the future Edit a couple typos,0,10,1733632317.0

The difference between a 3 month and 12 month emergency fund Lets say your monthly expenses are 6k So like a responsible adult you listen to the advice given by financial advisors who say you should have an emergency fund of 612 months So being extra conservative you do 12 months for a total of 72k a year You feel a bit of comfort knowing you could survive many emergencies But is this really a wise move mathematically Person A has a 12 month emergency fund in a HYSA 72k After 5 years that 72k gets about 4 interest a year It will grow to 88k Barely beating inflation Person B has a 3 month emergency fund of 18k The extra 60k he puts into VOO After 5 years it is now 125k Person A basically lost 37k because he was so conservative with his emergency fund But its worse if you look at reality the last 5 years You couldnt get 4 on HYSA until recently And inflation was worse than 4 So Person A probably lost close to 50k because of having a large emergency fund It gets worse What if the emergency fund was for 10 years in VOO 12 month fund after 10 years 84000 3 month fund after 10 years 170000 After 15 years 12 month 90k 3 month 374k You are literally throwing away hundreds of thousands of dollars down the drain if you have an oversized emergency fund Im going to be honest Personally I have had a 12 month fund for over a decade I basically threw away 100k for no reason For those 10 years I never had to use my emergency fund even with layoffs and unexpected large expenses The lesson is dont think having a too big emergency fund isnt a problem Over 20 years you could lose hundreds of thousands of dollars Im not saying no one should have a 12 month fund Im not saying everyone should have a 3 month fund It depends on my many factors how many months you need But dont fall in the same trap I did thinking that more is better No it isnt This is a decision that could cost you 500000 or even millions over the course of your working career,0,75,1733630917.0

SMCI looking like a comeback kid story right about now SMCI golden age and beautiful chart After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team We just saw in the last month of 72 rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around 48 the last critical level we saw was 49 Also it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming My half baked technical analysis is We will see a minor pull back around 50 to finish the pattern then it will launch back up to the next critical level around 60 a share Fundamentally speaking they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors especially their trademark marked water cooled rack which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 219 the earnings per share is a humble 2 the ps ratio is 15 which is the lowest among its competitors In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD which is 11 There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more I was going to buy on the next red day expecting it to be Monday but I digress Next pull back Im buying calls with a strike price of about 4955 exp in March Even considering a YOLO God Speed to the investors and traders,0,0,1733620243.0

Question regarding capital loss carryforward time limit Hi all I was recently going over some of my old tax returns and discovered that I had a significant amount of capital loss on my 2003 tax return result of the internet bubble crash that I never used at all in the subsequent years This happened because I switched tax preparers and I was also not active in the market for a while after I never applied the 2003 carry forward loss to offset any gains or even take 3000 against earned income in the years after 2003 I want to use this amount this year and going forward if possible I researched it online and it says that capital loss carry forward does not expire until fully used However my tax preparer said that I lost 3000 from that amount every year after 2003 even though it was never actually applied That basically means I lost 60k from that amount 3000 x 20 years I can offset the rest of the amount this year against my gains and continue to carry forward the balance if anything remains I called the IRS customer service line and they couldnt help at all They basically said to go into an IRS center to find an answer Do you think my tax preparer is correct and I lost 3k every year after or what I read online is correct and the entire amount is still available Thank you in advance,1,4,1733605223.0

Diversification from US only into exUS due to valuation Im a fan of Big ERN author of early retirement now Hes a proponent of 100 US only US stocks have been on a tear the past decade and a half and now with valuations high CAPE in the 30s large federal deficit is it prudent to allocate 1520 of a portfolio to exUS where valuations are much more attractive Most US only proponents argue that a lot of SP 500 companies generate revenue overseas so its enough diversification but there are still a ton of midlarge cap companies that is missed And if correlation between US and exUS is high is there a point in diversifying outside of US since any bear market in the US will ripple throughout the world Thoughts,6,16,1733600163.0

Retirement investing Q Target Date Fund vs Index Mix Hi folks Im 33 yo and plan to work until 65 so still early on in my working career Im taking advantage of my employer matching retirement contributions and contributing 15 each month When I first started at my current job 4 yrs ago I picked a Target date Vanguard target 2055 fund for all of my investments without giving it a lot of thought Now Im looking at the performance of this target date fund compared to their regular index fund options SP large cap mid small intl The large and mid cap indexes seem to be handily outperforming the target date fund over every time frame 1yr 3yr 5yr 10yr while the small cap has been fairly similar and the international index has been worse While none of the fees on these funds are outrageous the US based index fund fees are still a fraction of the target date fees 02 and 015 vs 065 with the target date Since Im still early on in my career with lots of time to ride out the market ups and downs Im wondering if it would be better to move from the target date fund and into these indexes to take advantage of the lower fees The target date allocation is 54 domestic stock 35 international stock and 11 bondscash At this point in my career I dont feel like I need to have anything in bondscash If I were to spread out my money between large mid and small cap US indexes and the international index would this not be diversified in a similar way to the target date fund with the exception of bondscash Obviously the downside is that I have to decide when to move back into more conservative holdings as I get later into my career But if I decided I wanted to have this managed for me when Im in my 50s couldnt I just move back into the 2055 target date fund at that time TIA for your comments,5,5,1733597460.0

Whats stopping me from investing all my money I always hear from people that you want a certain percentage of your money in liquid cash in case for emergencies But does that still really hold true in 2024 I have never really come across emergencies where I suddenly needed more than a couple thousand which I can easily just put on my credit card My credit card limit is something like 25k but even if it was 10k when would I be in a situation that I needed to pay a 10k bill on the spot Being my boring frugal ass self this would never really happen Hospital bills for example do not need to be paid for right away The only situation I can think of is for some reason you are in a different country stuck in the middle of nowhere and you have to pay some business cash for some reason But even in 3rd world countries having been to many myself credit card payment systems are basically universal and I never had issues with needing cash And even then you would obviously want to plan your cash liquidity before some kind of major trip like that to a remote part of the world So my question is what is stopping me from A putting a majority of my money 6070 into stocks and then B putting the rest into the highest possible interest return accounts Aka TBills high return CDsmoney market that return better than high interest savings accounts but are obviously less liquid And then leaving literally only enough in my checking to pay off my rent and credit card statement each month,0,44,1733595157.0

Is the stock market a bit of a Pyramid scheme Does anybody else think there is an element of Pyramid scheme in the whole stock market Of course everybody understands that businesses have real value both through their assets and their future cash flows So holding stocks is holding real value But recently the valuations of the whole market have been more and more decoupled from the underlying value The SP 500 PE is at 30 which has been exceeded historically only four times 1999 2001 1009 2021 Taking the inverse it means a 33 earrnings yield SPY dividend yield is 15 Compared to bonds this is terrible Which means stock gains are mainly driven by capital appreciation While business growth is a thing itd be hard for business earnings growth to be in line with expected stock value growth Stock prices are determined by supply and demand Supply of publicly traded stock of good successful businesses is limited Demand is ever growing through availability of capital because of wider use of 401k more international investors banking on the SP500 and loose money policy by the Fed And since everybody says that stocks go up over long term historically everybody considers VOO a safe longterm investment for their capital The question I ask myself How much of that is perception and selffulfilling prophecy how much of it is based on intrinsic real value growth and how sustainable is this If everybody just keeps doing this because they think its a good investment this can be a selfreinforcing cycle for a long time see Bitcoin I dont want to repeat the clichee of a bubble which implies that it has to burst soon This cycle can go on easily for another decade or two Sowhat do you guys think is there a chance that longterm stocks can decouple from their underlying fundamentals in ways not seen in the past some may say ETFs are at fault dont buy into SP500 but take your chances with lesser known stock but thats not the point If demand for stocks as a whole is too big to be kept in check then the money has to flow somewhere and that affects even smaller caps for niche investors,0,31,1733561380.0

Meaning of ROI when it is a statistic on a stock Hello what is the meaning of ROI when it is a statistic on a stock I understand in general what ROI Is but how is it calculated in that context pMaybe it is the ROI if you bought the IPO on day one pI mean it is pretty obvious how you get ROI return on investment generally speaking You take the current value of the investment and then divide by the cost basis and then come up with an annualized percentage right Like if the ROI on Willis Towers Watson is 16 actual stat then it means you earned an annualized return of 16 on the stock pCool But then I wonder what is the time frame here Does this mean I got into the IPO and bought the stock right away when it opened that day Is ROI calculated from that pOr maybe it is something else like the return over the past year or the past five years Its just not clear to me I could use the help of someone like you who is more knowledgeable about investing thanks,0,6,1733548808.0

COVID as a Mini Lost Decade By overlaying earnings and market cap we can get a pretty rough story of what happened with COVID and money printing and interest rate hikes and what this means for the future This image below is a bunch of large companies that represent the SPY The colored areas are their earnings with their predicted earnings in a lighter shade and the black line is their combined market cap price Ive annotated a few arrows to explain what seems to have roughly happened Orange Arrow 2020 2022 Interest rates drop which causes excess liquidity to flood the market Those who already had assets saw huge portfolio increases This new wealth combined with low interest caused a housing price boom New money in the hands of retail caused cults to form around memes like GME Plus no one wants to work and is wfh Red Arrow 2022 A lost decade is a period of time where new investors have no access to good investments People who just started working in 2022 or decided to start investing in 2022 had no good place to put their money and would only have broken even in 2024 the horizontal dash In a larger crisis like with Japans lost decades you have 1020 years where the stock market effectively grinds sideways Red Orange If you overlay the SPY with the Feds interest rate policy you can see that it looks to have caused some temporary price distress but long term the price is correlated with earnings not interest rate A lost decade is effectively exuberance that pulls forward price appreciation and steals it from future investors In the COVID response those who had assets in 2020 benefited while those who started investing in 2022 had a difficult time bc they didnt have access to the exponential growth of markets Blue Line Long term investors who think in decades and dont actually need large purchases like cars or weddings like old people can just ignore these bumps and focus on long term earnings The above is obviously oversimplified but its an example of how using earnings and price in tandem allows you to see the underlying story behind price movement If you just focus on price all you can do is draw a line up and the right and say things that are true like AAPL is a good company You have no perspective The worst example is someone who got scared of investing in stocks in 2020 but seeing everyone around him get rich for 2 years he decides to start investing in 2022 and loses money for two years and decides to stop and then starts watching everyone around him make more money in a neverending spiral of 2 year delayed FOMO Its like relying on a tourist pamphlet in a foreign city If you cant make a judgement of quality independently then you will always pay high prices and wait in long lines,0,1,1733530251.0

At what point is it worth taking short term capital gains tax I have a stock that bought earlier this year that has run up over 90 I tend to always want to hold at least a year to avoid the larger tax hit and typically hold much longer Dont consider myself a trader at all However this run up is more than I expected to gain in this particular stock in such a short amount of time that I am starting to think it may be worth taking the gains and the ensuing tax hit I also believe the fundamentals are getting completely out of whack The stock has become overvalued but it does have momentum built in its story thus the big run up It is a very small position in my portfolio and no I dont need the money at this timeIm interested in hearing peoples generally thoughts when it comes to having to decide on short term capital gains implications I can provide more information in the comments Thanks everyone Edit Since Ive been asked a few times the stock is HIMS,37,50,1733523792.0

Why Im likely to Capitulate and buy Bitcoin Im a big fundamental guy with stocks Hate technicals Bitcoin is something Ive never owned and basically swore off With it hitting 100k a coin it made me think Okay here is a thing valued at 23 trillion with no fundamental value Its totally based on belief kinda like Santa or whatever Then I thought about the last 3 years with crypto companies defrauding investors it tanking and still it came back It just went through probably one of the largest questioning of faith ever and people still believe to the tune of new all time highs What could cause an even greater loss in faith than defrauding billions from people With more regulations coming it will likely better legitimize crypto causing more belief Rocks art and unbuildable land all have value even though they dont produce cash flows Bitcoin is self fulfilling it has value only because people believe it has value and it seems like that isnt going to go away anytime soon Cash in and of itself doesnt have value but because we accept it it does People are accepting bitcoin more If I am going to buy it will be a small amount each month and DCA rather than allocate a block of my portfolio,0,88,1733505697.0

Older woman seeks simple advice Thanks for responses I was in a brain swirl about a few things and this was a quick reality check I really need to have a discussion with my manager about a few things so he doea indeed earn his fees Hi the question is should I put an IRA contribution into the current IRA account I have with my financial advisor or should I open a separate one that I control I am in my 60s and have a financial advisor paid managing a mixed portfolio plus an independent account not with advisor with cash all within one brokerage house My income has been alimony ending soon and some work and investment returns I want to put 8000 into an IRA this year and next to reduce my taxes I havent been doing it and it wont reduce my taxes much but I have the funds available I have both a Roth and an IRA from divorce but they are within the managed portfolios I guess I feel like the advisors just get more of my money and that means more of a to them Thanks for any thoughts on this,4,9,1733429394.0
My biggest fear for 2025 is declines becoming contagious if one part of the economy hiccups When has this not been a risk its why the economy acts as a ratchet going up slow but down fast But 2025 seems particularly risky IMO because of the valuations on well everything Stocks real estate crypto govt debt None of them on their own pose any catastrophic problems in isolation but what happens to all of them together when theres a hiccup Theres an article in the Economics forum about commercial real estate woes By itself its not the end of the world but with the govt debt where its at dropping fed rates back to 0 with bank failures wont have the same effect cause bond vigilantes will ramp up the 10 year If stocks fall what happens to home prices when they are both at all time highs In 2008 they both went down What if stocks fall then crypto freaks then stocks fall more What is this going to do to AI if funding slows What if they all fall a little bit and that cycle repeats The biggest safegap seems to be rich people holding a ton of cash but they arent necessarily going to catch a falling knife To me the most insulated assets to protect for this seem to be international equity Prices are comparatively low lessening the air gap and in an actively deglobalizing world the correlation should be minimizing Like if the US has a mini meltdown South Africa should be chugging along ok and vice versa,119,107,1733428390.0

Best strategy for RMD withdrawals I have an inherited IRA account postCARES act so I have to withdraw the entire balance by 2032 I am also a California resident and get hit with the income tax with any withdraw My financial planner had the strategy to draw it down 10 a year and then reinvest the withdraws in a brokerage account which seems like a decent strategy My question however is if would be better taxwise to defer withdraws until closer to the mandatory withdraw date then change state residency to a noincome tax state We had planned to move anyway from California for retirement because we dont want to get gouged by the state on our 401ks so would just be doing this early So basically Take the 10 withdraws now paying state federal OR defer until closer to 2032 change residencies and only pay federal,1,15,1733423705.0

Bitcoin isnt speculative and it solves the Byzantine Generals problem I dont know how technical I should get in this OP but a lot of traditional investors are still too biased against bitcoin because they dont understand the technology They are the same kind of people who said dont invest in AMZN because no body will want to buy books on these new fangled online stores What is the Byzantine Generals problem Its probably one of those most valuable problems in human civilization if we were to put monetary value on it It is a problem where one person cant trust the others in a group Its typically encountered in complex organizations or where technology requires fidelity Ai So Bitcoin can both enforce fidelity and fault tolerance across the Ai spectrum and across human civilization The US DoD also publishes papers on another application of Bitcoin which is cryptography which is why almost all of the global mining is expectedly split between China Russia and US each controlling about 30 share Because the three super powers recognize that a bitcoin wrapper around data effectively puts a price tag on that data Lastly how does the mining subsidy work Subsidy is pulled from the white paper its not a miners reward its a subsidy The subsidy puts a price floor on Bitcoin by ensuring that transaction fees are not prohibitively expensive until bitcoin is large enough to make meaningful transactions If we think of the subsidy in terms of bitcoin only then when it first began the transaction fee was something like 50 bitcoin Four halvings later and it went to 25 125 625 and now 3125 bitcoin So it costs 3125 bitcoin to transact right now and is entirely subsidized Think of transactions as a bank with limited teller windows and you auction aka bid the highest price for use of that teller window Transactions take place on the Lightning network and companies like AMZN are building their own Lightning networks which are basically like owning your own credit card company where you take a fee for the use of the credit card So companies are already branching into this So lets recap the technology to see how its not a speculation at all its the next Ai or Internet or etc 1 It solves Byzantine Generals problem solving one of the most valuable problems in human history by allowing Ai and organizations to have fidelity between systems 2 It is a massive cryptographic engine that puts a price tag on the value of whatever is being protected A hacker has to spend that much money to defeat the encryption 3 It has aguaranted floor in price that is inverseproportional to the cost of the transactions as measured in the Bitcoin subsidy given to miners The fewer coin used in transaction cost at greater power usage fiat cost then the greater the fiat value of Bitcoin 4 The Lightning network is the offchain payment method that Bitcoin uses and that generates fees for the operators of the nodes and those fees are like credit card fees generating revenue for the operators of the ecosystem If you ever worried about investing in Bitcoin because its a Gamble its no more a gamble than investing in CocaCola or a power plant,0,66,1733419303.0
