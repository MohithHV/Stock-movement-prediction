SMCI loose analysis and opportunity simmering ,"SMCI golden age and beautiful chart. 

After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent! Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock! It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud. Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team. 

We just saw in the last month of 72% rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around $48, the last critical level we saw was $49.

Also, it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming. My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. 

Fundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. 

There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs.

I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress. Next pull back I’m buying calls with a strike price of about $49-$55 exp in March. Even considering a YOLO. God Speed to the investors and traders.

MSTR Achilles Heel ,"The streets do not like MSTR. 
This is not an opinion . 
And ETF is the way to kill the beast. 


EDIT: MSTR IS NOT BTC . NEW ETF DOES NOT MEAN MSTR GO UP . BTC GO UP , ETF GO UP , BUT MSTR STAY STAGNATE WHY ? Because there is more opportunity at cheaper valuations elsewhere for the same exposure to BTC AND MUCH safer then MSTR. 


Insititons do not own and will not own MSTR  at these levels without a strong hedge . 20-30% for institution is enough for them to call it a day since they control billions in client money and  having different goals then you an I. You are waiting for hundreds  of percentage gains over leveraged without a hedge  . They need a few percentages  with a hedge and they pull the rug. 

 
The  launch of Bitcoin ETFs, which would allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without owning it directly, has already shifted  the flow of capital away from individual assets like MicroStrategy to these ETFs. This already lowered the demand for MicroStrategy stock, which is seen as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure.

The crazy part ? Hundreds of ETF are due to launch within 30-60 days . 


Sailor is purchasing as much BTC as possible so that he is able to justify MSTR being more expensive then BTC. He is doing so before it’s too late when the inflow comes in into ETFS .  This is apparent in his aggressive purchasing , every time he purchase and BTC went up he becomes closer to trying to get MSTR to the value of BTC . Very hard to do and now nearly impossible 


Historical Example: During the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, speculative capital flowed into individual tech stocks, but when ETFs like the NASDAQ-100 became popular, investors moved into the ETF, shifting capital away from individual companies. Similarly, when financial instruments like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) became widely adopted, it drew capital away from individual stocks in favor of more diversified portfolios.

Volume and Liquidity: Bitcoin ETFs would allow for larger, more fluid trading compared to MicroStrategy’s relatively low-volume stock. In 2023, the average daily trading volume of Bitcoin-related stocks like MicroStrategy was in the hundreds of millions. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs could see daily volumes in the billions of dollars, further attracting capital from micro-cap stocks.


Correlation between Bitcoin and MicroStrategy: Over the last three years, the correlation coefficient between MicroStrategy’s stock and Bitcoin’s price has ranged from 0.8 to 0.9 (on a scale from -1 to 1). This indicates a near-perfect correlation—investors in MicroStrategy are essentially betting on Bitcoin's price trajectory. Once Bitcoin ETFs increase in market presence, this direct correlation may weaken, causing MicroStrategy’s stock to lose its status as a Bitcoin proxy",0,38,1733614423.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h95c51/mstr_achilles_heel/

Nuclear Power Will Be Essential for Building out AI Data Centers,"At the rate we are building out GPU data centers, and fabs for new chips in the U.S. (TSMC already has two in Arizona) to fuel our AI revolution, we are now in desperate need of more electricity.  Wind and solar are great, but they will never be able to compete with nuclear power.  

Brookfield (NYSE: BN, BAM, BRP) recognized this unmet need a few years back, and bought Westinghouse on the cheap after Westinghouse filed bankruptcy.  They partnered with Cameco, a uranium fuel supply company, so that Brookfield has the 51% controlling interest in Westinghouse, and Cameco owns the other 49%.

Westinghouse tech is in approximately half the world's existing nuclear reactors, and it could benefit from a push to replace suppliers to the more than 30 western reactors that currently operate on Russian technology.

Westinghouse has already designed a small nuclear reactor, the AP1000

My thesis on INTC going into 2025,"I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30

I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed.

Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs.

In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now.

It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering.

However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act.

TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of.

So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants.

I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025.

If you got this far, thank you for reading.

EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit.",106,117,1733555831.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h8n76e/my_thesis_on_intc_going_into_2025/
Airline tickets are like options contracts if you really think about it. Are they tradable?,"(joke btw)

I just came to an interesting realization today as I was making my vacation plans. I checked the price of some tickets online after checking them last week only to find they increased in price. This reminded me of options.

I mean, think about it

You buy a ticket (option contract) with an airline (like a stock) with a destination (strike price or whatever) for a date in the future (expiration date). If you buy right before a major holiday (earnings season) your ticket will increase in value leading up to it (IV effect) and if you chose not to fly (not to exercise) your ticket becomes worthless (IV/Theta crush?).

And sometimes you can fly on standby, that is called placing a market order

The only difference is that there are major liquidity issues (limited amount of seats) and leaps don’t usually cost that much.

Buckle up regards, this is the DD of a lifetime. Imagine if we built an exchange on this.

If you want to see my past plays, check my profile.  I called the MRNA bounce, the NVDA sell off, the NKE bounce, but the UPST one was a bit off(still think it’ll happen).  

Why would i do something so dumb?  Because I like spotting trend reversals as they’re happening.  On the daily chart, you can clearly see the trend line break today.  The MACD is turning over, the RSI is dropping even though we’re still near the short term top, and that is a very convincing red candle on the daily.  

On the 30 minute, you can see the aggressive break more clearly, but more importantly to me is the fact that the 50 day and 100 day EMA’s have crossed to the downside for the first time since August 30.  That is fucking crazy that it took that long for that to happen.  IMO that is a very bearish signal that I am not going to ignore.  

I’m not going to go into CVNA’s financials or practices or the fact that they inflate their GPPU.  There are SO many DD’s about how it’s overvalued and a scam company.  Everyone knows that, but it just continues its stupid melt up.  That is, until next week.  I’m hoping other traders see this and decide to start selling/shorting this bitch into oblivion.  They probably won’t tho and my contracts will expire worthless, but we’ll see.

One thing to note;  CVNA’s delinquencies are at 12.6% and rising.  Their partner, Ally financial, warn in September that their delinquencies on auto loans was 20 bps higher than expected.  That’s significant.  Ally’s stock took a hit for that but CVNA didn’t because CVNA is not on the hook for the trash loans they sell to Ally.  However, Ally can increase their underwriting standards and make it harder for CVNA to give loans to every regard with a pulse.  Honestly this smells a lot like mortgages in 2008.  Eventually this will blow up, it’s just a matter of when.  And I’m not saying it’ll blow up this week.  I just like the technical setup.  

In closing, this is stupid and no one should do this.  But I like a challenge, and I like being right.  I only have 3 $240 puts so far, I may get more Monday.  It’s not a big bet at all, but i want some skin in the game so I can say I’m right if it plays out how I think it will.  Not financial advice, and do not tail me unless you’re ok with losing what you put in.  ",125,152,1733546121.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h8kpcn

Help Analyzing The ODP Corporation,"Finding value in this market seems near impossible. But, I think I may have found a cigar butt — Office Depot. Here’s my back of the envelope math that I’m hoping y’all can help fill out a little more. This is just a primer to get the convo flowing. Please keep it civil, factual, and support assertions with numbers/facts. Please. 

In 2015 staples tried to purchased Office Depot for $6.3b, but the deal was killed by the FTC. They tried again in 2021 offering $2.1b. This got me wondering, why? Where’s the value? Well, there may be a little. 

ODP is comprised of Four business units: 1) ODP Business Solutions, LLC (B2B); 2) Office Depot, LLC (retail); 3) Veyer, LLC (logistics); and 4) Varis, Inc. (digital procurement). 

 The latter 2 are interesting and showed  decent growth: Veyer (25%) and Varis (14%). ODP “sold” most of Varis but still owns about 20%. They actually paid the buyer to take it off their hands (this plays a small role in my broader thesis of why ODP NEEDS to sell, the leadership is totally incompetent). 

The company is shrinking, and rapidly. But they have $181mm in cash. Net income of $139mm. Receivables are $487mm. Inventory $765mm. They own real estate that’s worth about $86mm (but hard to confirm). $1.04B in debt. Total liabilities of 2.785B. Current market cap is $779mm. 

Removing debt from the equation, conservatively I put the value around $1.1b. That’s a 41% delta/upside. 

But, factoring in debt, it’s a different picture (obviously). They’ve manage to decrease their interest expense every year, going from $89mm in 2019 to $20mm in 2023. They recently restructured their revolver and the new maturity date is 2029, so they have time. There’s also a $250mm accordion allowing them to increase the loan from $800mm to $1.05b. 

The logistics component (veyer) seems interesting and promising but it sounds like they’re looking may be unhappy with Norman’s there as well — again just really poor management. 

EBITDA: $417mm
Adjusted: $131mm

Takeda Pharmaceutical,"Hi guys 

Narcolepsy Type 1 (NT1) is a tough gig—caused by orexin loss, it messes up your sleep-wake cycle big time. Symptoms like excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (random muscle weakness from emotions), bad sleep at night, hallucinations, and even social issues make life rough. Plus, diagnosis can take over a decade because it’s often mistaken for other stuff.

Takeda’s new drug, TAK-861, is aiming to change the game. It’s an orexin receptor 2 agonist that could hit the root cause of NT1, not just the symptoms. Early trials look good—people stay awake better, have fewer cataplexy episodes, and generally feel more functional. Phase 3 trials started in 2024, and it might set a new treatment standard. They’re also testing another orexin drug, TAK-360, for related sleep disorders like NT2 and idiopathic hypersomnia.

Takeda’s also working on wearables and digital tools to speed up diagnosis and improve patient care. Big expectations here—this could be first-in-class treatment!

Current price: $13.74
ATH: $30.34

It might reach its ATH again if an orexin agonist gets approved.",9,13,1733518236.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h8bee2/takeda_pharmaceutical/

AppLovin's success is largely due to its continued investment and innovation in AI technology, such as the AXON 2.0 AI-driven technology used in the AppDiscovery platform, which has dramatically increased advertisers' spending and advertising realization rates

Palantir, its specific business, from defense to healthcare, from energy to finance, Palantir's solutions can flexibly adapt to the needs of a variety of industries, and AppLovin and called the twin giants, the strength of the strength must not be underestimated

Both companies are driving the U.S stock AI application sector higher and higher, but also bring great inspiration to other companies, telling us that AI technology is indeed the future trend

Correction on my recent palantir short thesis,"A few weeks ago I made a detailed post about how Palantir is ridiculously overvalued and the final boss of stock market bubbles.

Since then, the stock went up 25% in about 13 trading sessions, adding roughly $40B of enterprise value.

The EV/sales multiple expanded from 51x revenue to 64x revenue.

Excluding interest gained on cash, the company now trades at 450x operating income. Many companies experience this only when their earnings are swinging wildly from year to year - but palantir really just is this expensive.

By buying a share of Palantir now, you have the privilege of laying claim to a whopping $1.19 in revenue and $0,16 of operating income on a $76 share price. 

Needless to say I got absolutely hosed on my short position. So I will take my L and get back in my bear cave.

Thus, I retract all of my statements and condense my newly formed sentiment to this: Palantir is the greatest stock of all time.

STLA Mid Term Play,"Never thought I would be pushing this company as a good play, but still makes sense.

$STLA CEO was just canned because he was an imbecile who thought cutting everything could turn around a company.

The stock is cheap, options are super cheap, and while they can always go down another 99.99% this one is still making tons of money.

It is just about the biggest bargain on the market. P/E is roughly 3 now, and forward P/E is like 3.7. they have valuable brands like Jeep and Dodge. Once they appoint a new CEO this should jump significantly (and bonus points if they aren't euro trash).

I picked up a tiny play on Monday after seeing the news and that the stock was down as a result. Up 70% so far. It will take a bit for a new CEO search, but that is why half-leaps are a great play, not out of the question for this to climb back to the 20s by that time.

"Lululemon jumps more than 18%, beats Q3 earnings and raises Q4 guidance","LULU was up more than 18% in today's session, touching $409.16, a new high since March of this year. According to the latest earnings report, Lululemon's third-quarter revenue reached $2.4 billion, exceeding my expectation of $2.36 billion and above the company's previous forecast of a range of $2.34 billion to $2.37 billion. The revenue growth was significant compared to the $2.2 billion reported in the same period last year. In addition, earnings per share (EPS) came in at $2.87, beating the market's estimate of $2.75 and up from $2.53 in the same period last year. The company expects fourth-quarter revenue to be in the range of $3.48 billion to $3.51 billion, slightly below the market's estimate of $3.5 billion, and expects EPS to be in the range of $5.56 to $5.64, below my estimate of $5.70

For investors holding Lululemon, it is recommended to maintain a holding attitude and continue to focus on its long-term growth potential. For new investors considering entry, they can wait for further stock price adjustment in the near term and consider a gradual layout if the price retraces to more attractive levels. Overall, however, Lululemon remains a quality growth stock that deserves long-term attention.",52,25,1733501300.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h84sq6/lululemon_jumps_more_than_18_beats_q3_earnings/

# Article summary:

* Nvidia's Dominance: Nvidia is a leading player in the AI chip market, experiencing significant revenue growth and stock performance. Over the past five years, Nvidia's stock has surged by 2,600%, and it's on track for a gain of more than 180% this year.
* Competition: Nvidia faces competition from other chip designers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as well as from its own customers, such as Meta Platforms and Amazon, who are developing their own AI chips.
* Product Launches: Nvidia recently launched the H200 chip, which delivers twice the inference performance of its predecessor and quickly reached double-digit billion-dollar revenue. The company is also preparing to launch its Blackwell architecture and its most powerful chip ever.
* Market Concerns: Despite Nvidia's strong position, there are concerns that cost-conscious customers might shift to competitors offering lower-priced AI chips.",0,10,1733494714.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h82cr1/nvidia_ceo_just_announced_bad_news_for_nvidias/

Investment Strategy 2025 ,"Hello
I have been reading that VOO is getting pretty over valued and analysts are predicting slower rates of returns the next decade like maybe 3%.

Context 51 male - stable income.  

Currently I manage about 1/7th of my overall monetary net worth in an investment account.  The other accounts are 401k age based or intelligent robot AI oriented.  I also have a dividend managed fund with Schwab

The portion I manage has done really well with a lot of emphasis on tech and mag 7 as well as some other instruments like JEPI.

I am thinking of going in two directions with year end bonuses to spread some risk..

Some international indexes like maybe UK - The PE ratio average is half of SP 500

In addition going to double down on JEPI (had been great) and going to go after some intermediate corporate bonds to balance things a bit.

Who else is thinking US Small Caps and what indexes do you like?  

What are other people thinking as far as VOO/500 vs international indexes like UK, Japan?

Thoughts on Nano-X Imaging (NNOX),"I've been DCA'ing for the past two years. It sailed high and fell out of favor due to rumors of being the next Theranos.

Positives:

* On Thursday, Dec 5th, they received full FDA approval for the Nano-x ARC.
* This product is a cheaper proposition for X-rays. Facilities do not need to buy the device upfront (anyone can get one). 
* Their TAM is massive. U.S., EU & Global Imaging Market.
* Their per-x-ray cost is cheaper than that of traditional machines. 
* They have a cold cathode tube patent (large moat), low debt, 
* A Xerox income model based on subscriptions and per-usage fees.
* Insurance companies could save a bundle and should push for these devices.

Negatives:

* Even though this company could change the world with low-cost X-rays, its investor outreach and marketing are severely underdeveloped.
* They'll need to raise capital again. That could dillute shareholders.
* The stock has been heavily shorted over the past several years.",1,0,1733518189.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h8bdpq/thoughts_on_nanox_imaging_nnox/

What would you consider a good entry point for bitcoin?,"Bitcoin recently hit a value of $100k, as I’m sure we are all aware by now.

Arguably, bitcoin has been one of the most successful investments over the last 10 years, up there with NVDA and other Mag 7 stocks.

I won’t lie, I’ve been a Bitcoin hater for most of my investing career. It’s tough to conceptualize fully, it has not always been mainstream enough so it’s understandable to be leery of it, and its supporters are so ardent and ravenous that it feels like a cult. I don’t blame any skeptics for not putting their money into it.

That said, over the last year or two, it has certainly gained a ton of legitimacy as it has played a significant role in Trump’s presidential campaign and also begun to be an asset that hedge funds are also purchasing.

I, like many others I assume, want to make it a part of my portfolio, but it’s tough to analyze its value because it doesn’t act like your usually security exchanged on the stock market. There are no balance sheets or income statements for bitcoin to look at, and I have no idea if its valuation is way too high or too low.

I can certainly see it continuing to go up in the near to mid term future. If you told me it would hit $200k in the next two years, I wouldn’t be surprised. That said, I also wouldn’t be surprised if it also hit $40k in the next two years too.

Is now a good time to buy? There’s a lot of hype around it after it just hit $100k in value, so I’m nervous about jumping into it right now, but I’m struggling to put together a fair value estimate that I should wait for it to hit before I buy.

Seeking Feedback on My 200k Investment Strategy at 24,"Hi fellow investors,

I recently inherited **$200k** and have been investing for the past five years with great success—my portfolio is up 130% over the last 2 years. However, I've typically been working with smaller amounts, i've invested for a total of $10k, so managing this larger sum feels a bit more overwhelming.

* **20% META** (I have a strong belief in META's potential)
* **15% GOOG** (I think it’s undervalued, and once the current lawsuit is behind them, it will grow)
* **10% TSM**
* **10% MSFT**
* **2.5% LULU**
* **2.5% ORCL**

I’d love to get your thoughts on my portfolio. I know it’s quite tech-heavy, but throughout my investing journey, I’ve had good results with companies I understand and believe in, and would like to stick with that strategy. I’m young and comfortable with taking on some risks, as I believe time is on my side.

Looking forward to your constructive feedback!

Higher-risk low $ partner to the S&P500?,"Hi friendds!

So most of my money goes into a tax-free locked tracker of the S&P500 (local governmental thing, albeit with a maximum yearly cap)

  
When I reach the cap, I divert the remaining funds into my brokerage app (IBKR) - We are talking small sums of money, **about 5000 dollars a year.**

  
I would like this to be in about similar risk of the S&P500 but also diversified somewhat, which makes the QQQ a bit obsolete? I thought maybe to put those yearly 5000 in QQQJ instead, or maybe even some russell 1000?   

I also would like the option to sell it (25% CGT) in case I needed money for a big-emergency in the future, as opposed to the locked main SP500 fund.

  
Thanks for any suggestions :) 

To clarify I am 30 years old, no current debt, currently in the process of advancing my business so that I have more options in the future.

For me, the biggest game-changer was nailing down a solid risk management plan. Like, it’s not the most exciting part of trading, but man, it’s what keeps you alive in the market. That, and not chasing every shiny setup that looks good for half a second.



Anyway, here are some things I’m curious about:

\- What was your biggest “aha” moment that took your trading to the next level?

\- How do you keep emotions in check especially during those wild, volatile days?

\- Got any tools, books, or resources that you swear by?

A short critique of Ray Dalio,"Ray Dalio has done an absolutely amazing job with Bridgewater Associates - kudos to him. However, I find that his viewpoints and his analyses, especially when it comes to China, are highly biased and, to an extent, nonsensical. Dalio has historically been a strong proponent of China, emphasizing its potential to surpass the US in economic dominance and advocating for the yuan taking the place of the USD as the next reserve currency. He held these views as recently as 3-5 years ago, but it feels like his stance has now moderated given what has happened in the last couple of years.

Dalio's earlier optimism about China's trajectory was grounded in its rapid economic growth, infrastructure development, and increasing global influence. Even at that time, several experts pointed out that he was underestimating structural issues such as China's aging population, mounting debt, and a slowing economy - something that he didnt seem to pay much heed to as he continued to toot the China horn. 

China's demographic crisis, with its shrinking workforce and rapidly aging population, has significantly impacted its long-term growth prospects. Geopolitical tensions, regulatory crackdowns on industries, and a cooling real estate market have further dampened investor sentiment. Which Dalio can finally see - quite late for an ""expert"", I feel

Recently, Dalio has changed his tune, almost ackowledging his mistake as he referred to China's situation as ""more challenging than Japan in 1990"". The arrogance he once had seems to have disappeared as he now emphasizes the need for caution and diversification, reflecting a shift from his earlier, unqualified enthusiasm to a more nuanced perspective​.",13,8,1733321449.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h6gwf4/a_short_critique_of_ray_dalio/

I Want to Hear Your Thoughts on the Qualities Intel’s Next CEO Should Have and Why,"With Pat Gelsinger retiring, the company is once again searching for a CEO who can steer it through its challenges.

Who do you think Intel needs next as CEO, and why? Should it be an insider with deep technical expertise or someone from outside with a fresh perspective? How do you think the leadership transition will unfold in the coming months/years?

Here’s a quick summary of Intel’s past CEOs, their departures, and the criticisms they faced, for reference:  


|**CEO**|**Predecessor's Reason for Departure**|**Public Criticism or Perceived Failures**|**Successor’s Key Attributes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Pat Gelsinger**|Bob Swan replaced due to lack of technical background|Struggled to regain process leadership; delays in 7nm; stiff competition from AMD and TSMC|Deep technical expertise, Intel veteran, proven leader at VMware|
|**Bob Swan**|Brian Krzanich resigned after a policy violation|Failed to address manufacturing delays; lacked vision to compete with AMD/ARM-based chips|Stability-focused leader with strong financial acumen|
|**Brian Krzanich**|Paul Otellini retired citing personal reasons|Poor handling of mobile market diversification; failed to anticipate ARM dominance|Manufacturing and operations expertise, Intel insider|
|**Paul Otellini**|Craig Barrett retired as part of a planned transition|Missed opportunities in mobile chips, allowing Qualcomm and ARM to dominate|Strategic thinker, strong marketing and client focus|
|**Craig Barrett**|Andrew Grove stepped down after transforming Intel|Slow diversification beyond PCs; overexposure to dot-com volatility|Deep engineering and manufacturing expertise|

**Questions to consider**:

* What should Intel prioritize in its next CEO: technical skills, operational expertise, or a focus on profitability?
* What qualities or background should this leader have to address Intel's challenges?
* How do you think this transition will impact Intel’s market position and stock performance?

Let’s look back in the future to see how close we were!  
And PLEASE PLEASE PLEAAAASE, DON'T COMMENT WITH EMOTIONS(Or at least, not mostly). Try being rational and logical with your replies.  ",4,11,1733291523.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h6962b/i_want_to_hear_your_thoughts_on_the_qualities/
Devon Energy - checking if I am missing anything,"Devon Energy (symbol DVN) is a pure play in crude oil and natural gas.  That is, it is not balanced out like larger energy companies.

I was hoping if anyone could advise if I am missing anything in what follows:

Traits of the stock include:

1. Valuation basics :  price to sales 1.58 TTM \[source Reuters\] backward looking PE 6.96 \[source Bigcharts\] very low compared to the overall market.
2. Not directly impacted by any potential new tariffs in 2025.  Any company that pulls their revenue out of the ground inside the USA will not see a tariff impact.
3. In general for fossil fuel companies - even though EVs  are on the rise, only 25% of a barrel of oil goes to light transport.  75% has uses from asphalt to plastics, and nat gas uses vary.

Regarding the future price of crude, I am not an expert but the resurgence in conflict in Syria would be an upward push to a small degree.

A recent downside has been that Devon has been working through acquisition of assets of Geryson Mill Energy.

SPHY Junk Bond ETF Question: How Stable is it and what are potential risks?,"What is the downside of high dividend Junk Bond ETFs such as SPHY? 

I realize Junk Bonds involve higher risk, so that's why there's a higher dividend yield, and I realize there is a risk of default on some of the bonds in their portfolio. But, as the entire ETF wouldn't seemingly default, in the event one or more bonds were to default, what's the overall downside risk, and/or what am I not understanding? 

I'm not understanding how this fund is considered high risk, given that it doesn't seem like the fund overall, has any high degree risk of tanking completely into default. Could the entire fund default, and, if so, do you have any examples where this has happened to similar bond fundsin the past? 

In other words, if you look at the Overall History of SPHY, as a fund, it hasn't defaulted, at any time, and while there have been small price fluctations, looking at the overall price history, I don't see such a dramatic decrease in value that would cause me to think it is a super risky investment, especially given that it pays a relatively high yield overall, and that yield has only been increasing over time (so far as I can tell). 

By way of background, I already have a diversified portfolio, all index funds, some HYSA, and assets. I'm comfortable, less than 10 years from retirement, definitely considered a conservative investor, overall, and am not looking to take on significant risk. 

I've been thinking of parking (for me) a relatively small amount of my bond allocation in a junk bond ETF, to take advantage of that higher yield. 

Am I overthinking this, and/or what am I not understanding, if anything, please?

Ethically, I feel good about Japan as an investment destination, but I’m curious about how others evaluate international stocks like these.

Capital gains loophole question ,"I am about 90% up on my QQQ (about 10k) that I bought a few years ago. I'll be finishing grad school in a couple weeks and have a job lined up where I will be making significantly more money than this previous year. Based on my tuition being tax deductible, I will have tax credits that will largely outweigh the amount of taxes I paid this year. Does it make sense to sell all of my QQQ and just rebuy it knowing that I probably I won't have to pay tax on it this year?

Outperforming the Market—Time to Let It Ride or Rebalance?,"Hi all,  
I recently reviewed my investment account and noticed it’s been outperforming the market with impressive returns. 🎉 (Not complaining!)

But now I’m wondering—should I leave it alone and ride the wave, or is it time to re-evaluate and diversify?

Some questions I’m considering:

* How do you decide when to take profits versus letting winners run?
* Are there specific signs or market conditions you watch for before rebalancing?

I’d love to hear how others manage a situation like this. Stick with what’s working, or play it safe and re-diversify?

Anyone else buying the NU dip?,"I’ve been an investor in NU for a while now. I firmly believe the market is panic selling because Warren Buffet sold 19% of his stake in the company.

Today the company is down again because Citi bank downgraded its rating on NU to a sell.

Why do people care that Citi bank downgraded to a sell? It’s literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets. Citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing, amazing company.

If anything, the downgrade should be seen as a good sign. It shows that american banks like Citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast NU has been able to expand its user base.

I know Brazil has made changes to its financial regulations. However, NU is rapidly expanding its user base to other countries. Plus, Brazils projected annual GDP growth per year is very good.

Do you guys agree?

EDIT:

(Thanks for all your thoughts. I’ve realized there are a few key things I overlooked.

I previously thought the stock was heavily owned by retail investors, similar to SoFi’s stock. I naively assumed this because the stock is frequently discussed on social media. Due to this preconceived notion, I believed the stock price would be significantly influenced by analyst ratings. I still think a large number of people have started to sell because of Warren Buffett reducing his stake and Citi’s sell recommendation. However, I now see that the primary factors driving this downturn are geopolitical and economic risks in Brazil.

My updated assessment is that the stock is being sold for a few very valid reasons. Firstly, Brazil’s inflation has been rising over the past few quarters. Secondly, Donald Trump has threatened BRICS nations with 100% tariffs if they decide to create a currency to rival the U.S. dollar. Thirdly, Warren Buffett sold 19% of his stake in the company. Fourthly, the value of Brazil’s currency has been declining and recently hit historic lows compared to the U.S. dollar. Finally, Brazil’s government spending was recently cut, potentially signaling a slowdown in their economy.

Overall, people are very concerned about the economic and geopolitical risks surrounding NU, especially since it is a Brazilian company. Brazil has a historically unstable economy and is currently facing economic headwinds that are amplified by the risk of potential tariffs.

I’m taking a cautious approach from here on out. I won’t be selling any shares, but I also won’t be buying more until the stock price consolidates and the Brazilian economy stabilizes.

I’m still very bullish on NU because the company has grown unbelievably fast in just 11 years. They survived Brazil’s economic collapse in 2014–2016, and they also weathered the last round of U.S. tariffs on Brazil in 2018. I believe NU will continue to expand rapidly into other Latin American countries, which will reduce its exposure to Brazilian tariffs and economic challenges. The CEO and management team are extremely competent, and I believe in their ability to navigate these challenges in the long term.

The worst-case scenario would be if the BRICS nations successfully create a new currency. Even then, I still believe NU will be okay due to its expansion into other markets. For now, I’m holding and remain very bullish on the business.)",6,34,1733151801.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h4wxti/anyone_else_buying_the_nu_dip/

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

"What's the stock pick you're most proud of? Most ashamed of? ($SQ, $O)","This doesn't have to be your biggest gainer or loser, although it's understandable if that ends up being your choice. What's you're overall gain on the stock? What about your choice are you most proud or most ashamed of? Would you advise investing in it today?

My most proud stock is $SQ, since it's my third highest gainer right now, and it was the first stock where I decided I should sell something I own to buy it. I sold my Disney stock to hold $SQ instead. I believe in cash app, and despite their recent move away from BTC investing, their part in the BTC business, as a place to safely purchase and move BTC to your own wallet reliably, or hold sats if you feel unsure of your own ability to secure your BTC, is highly profitable, moreso with every surge in price. I also thing their small business applications will improve over time, as any tech does. And being a big name early in the game will help in the long run. I also like Jack Dorsey because of his personal commitment to BTC and how he ran Twitter before Elon.

My most ashamed stock is realty income, $O, which despite all the rate cuts has gained less than 3% since I got it xP although has paid some dividends which I didn't reinvest because I didn't know how to yet. The big purchase it made relatively recently did not move the needle for me or apparently any of its other investors. Still hoping they diversify into more cash generating businesses outside of leasing property, as we've seen many retail businesses struggle in the modern age

"Am I stupid for using the market as my ""savings account?"" ","I come from a long line of poor financial planners. I'm 42 now and have always saved, but until a couple of years ago, it was just in a savings account. I dabbled with a Roth, saw that was doing well, opened a brokerage account and now have pretty much everything spread between Roth and regular investments.

I have a buffer in checking I don't go below and a couple thousand in savings in case I need it, which I haven't. Investing is going great, and I'm only kicking myself for not doing it sooner. However, are there any downsides to having most of my money in the market that I'm not considering?

3 Months of Gains! Let's go!,"Almost 6 months ago, I mutually agreed to part ways with my company. I was President of a Construction Company that was private equity backed and based in Milwaukee. A fun opportunity, and different environment compared to being a serial entrepreneur. Had the opportunity to service hundreds of customers, and build a brand at the expense of someone else! Definitely a cool chapter of my life. Unfortunately, my old man was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer on January 1, 2024 (Happy new year, I guess right?). He currently lives in India, and I split time between Milwaukee and Philadelphia. Without getting into the weeds, I resigned and relocated to India and travel back and forth every 3 months for a couple of weeks.

I decided over the summer, that I would begin full time trading. I have been passively investing in the market for the past 10 years, more active since the beginning of the pandemic. I have taught friends, made and then lost and then recovered and made again, I've been in and out of the market, but I decided to apply my approach at scale.

As an investor, I'm a believer in fundamentals, but also a big value investor. Being a serial entrepreneur and having scaled a variety of businesses in global markets, I have found that I have a deep understanding of valuation and value-prospects, I believe I have a similar approach and understanding to various MMs, and have used that approach intertwined with technical to read the market. My goal was to first generate enough monthly income to cover all liabilities I have on the books, approx. 7-8k per month in fixed expenses. I have multiple accounts where I trade options exclusively, but I decided I would set up a new account purely for trading of equities only.

I told my Old Man there were 251 trading days in a typical year, if I could average 1% per day, I would be able to generate 251% return. LOL... ambitious I know. I did a little math, looked at my trading history, and formulated a pricing strategy for entry and exit in various ticker symbols where I have done a lot of due diligence. It's funny...I found there are some names that I can never win on, and there are some names, that I can just continue to win with (all mental I know...) but I know the price levels realy well. Not every trade is a win, and you'll see that - but I use my losses as ticket symbols to attack on swing trades and recover my losses over the course of the upcoming year.

I created an account in Robinhood with $36,000 opening balance on September 3rd, 2024. I average about $13,000 in margin. I transfer any profits when I close a position and the equity balance is greater than $36,000.

Here are my results!

I completed the first 3 months, as of today, with a 92.26% return (Robinhood's percentages are all messed up because it's counts the withdrawals as capital reduction versus capital gains). I hope I can keep this up going forward! Wish me luck, regards.

Assuming they are able to push through massive cuts to the federal government, including possibly hundreds of thousands of layoffs among federal employees and contractors, how will the markets react? Up because of the lowered deficits, or down due to all the uncertainty?",0,35,1732903868.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h2rwkt/is_the_market_blind_to_the_tsunami_that_will_hit/

Thoughts on buying BRK.Binstead of S&P this month?,"
Does anyone have any thoughts on buying BRB.K this month as a one off instead of the usual DCA into S&P 500?

I usually allocate the same amount of money to S&P 500 every month and have done this for years. However given much the stock market is up (27% YTD), especially including the recent trump mania, I think we are due a pull back.

And the way Buffet has been selling stocks recently, so does he. However would spending the same amount this month on Berkshire Hathaway stock instead of S&P, as a one off, hedge against this risk. 

WB has the highest stock pile he’s ever had, whilst still in the market albeit much smaller. I was just thinking it as a way of further diversification - I’ll obviously keep all of my investments in the S&P but as a one off for this month was thinking it could be wise to load up on BH stock, so can receive the benefits of the business of interest from their cash holdings as well as their equity holdings. 

Do you guys think this is a reasonable thought process or just stick to the plan and keep DCAing into the S&P this month?

Thanks. ",17,26,1732891933.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h2ngjo/thoughts_on_buying_brkbinstead_of_sp_this_month/

Evaluating Solar/Wind Companies – Overwhelmed by KPIs,"I’m trying to evaluate a solar/wind company, and I’m finding it much more complicated than analyzing a “normal” tech or consumer company.

There are so many KPIs that I’m struggling to wrap my head around. For example, I’ve come across terms like Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and MWh produced, but it doesn’t stop there. Other metrics I’ve seen include:
	•	Capacity Factor: How efficiently the company uses its installed capacity.
	•	Installed Capacity (MW): The total capacity of their assets.
	•	Project Pipeline: Upcoming projects in development and their stages.
	•	PPA Contracts: Details of Power Purchase Agreements, like duration and pricing.
	•	O&M Costs: Operations and Maintenance expenses per MWh.

It feels overwhelming compared to the more familiar revenue growth, margins, and user metrics in tech or consumer companies.

How do you prioritize which KPIs to focus on when evaluating companies in this sector? Are there specific ones that are more critical depending on whether they’re utility-scale, distributed energy, or equipment manufacturers?",5,6,1732873965.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h2ig8u/evaluating_solarwind_companies_overwhelmed_by_kpis/

Individual AI software winners may be hard to pick, but surely the server farms are needed anyway. Is there an opportunity, and how are you exploiting it? With long experience in the software business I am aware that the AI world is maturing, but has a long way to go. I am sure we will see stories of AI-driven project failures. Equally, I’m sure we’ll see stories about great successes. But whichever way it goes there will be vast investment. So are you focusing your investments on AI platforms (if so, which), or hardware (Nvidia and others)  or Data Center REITs (American Tower, Equinix) or things like the Global X ETFs (which seem underperforming to me).

"Assaults, Cover-ups, Ruined Reputation, and a 51% Stock Drop — Any Chance For Wynn Resorts?","So here is the full story of one of the biggest stock drops of WYNN (though they haven’t recovered till this day). Also, anyone here with $WYNN? What’s your thoughts about it?   


[**https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/11/42050388/high-stakes-and-higher-scandals-inside-wynn-resorts-legal-and-ethical-crisis**](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/11/42050388/high-stakes-and-higher-scandals-inside-wynn-resorts-legal-and-ethical-crisis)  


First things first: Steve Wynn, the company’s founder, was key to its brand and success, as they positioned it. But then, in January 2018, the Wall Street Journal revealed sexual misconduct allegations against him, backed by over 150 interviews.  
  
  
These allegations, some dating back decades, led to investigations by Nevada and Massachusetts regulators. Both found Wynn guilty and uncovered a cover-up by senior executives (what a shocker, right?). The result was a staggering $55M in fines for the company.  


After that, the market reaction was fast. $WYNN stock plunged 18% in just days, triggering a lawsuit from investors. They accused the company of hiding Wynn’s misconduct and exposing them to financial risk.  
  


Now, after years of legal battles, Wynn Resorts has agreed to pay a $70M settlement. So, if you owned shares during this time, you might be eligible to submit a claim.



While the company has taken steps to rebuild its reputation — like securing a UAE gaming license, reducing debt, and launching a $1B share buyback program — $WYNN still trades at $93, down 51% from its 2018 peak of $192.

$Dell Earnings,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.

How are smaller companies having such a bad 1-2 years lately but big companies are booming?,"How are smaller companies in good fields taking such a hit over the last 1-2 years but big companies continue to boom?

I’m no expert but that just seems crazy and so inorganic. I get that the company’s themselves aren’t doing well or might have a bad financial year but down 90% or more in a year or two just doesn’t really make sense to me. 

For it to drop like that, it obviously means people are selling but in order for those sales to go through that means people are still buying the stock so somebody still believes in the company. 

And like they could have a bad year where revenue is down 25% or more than previous years, so how does that justify a 90% drop? Or maybe they’re running low on cash, and really the only way to raise cash to help their situation is issuing shares, or a reverse split or whatever. If cash on hand is their biggest problem, wouldn’t making the stock price go up help the company and then lead to more growth? Granted cash-on-hand is probably hardly the biggest factors in these drops but just trying to grow my knowledge. 

I thought the stock market kinda went hand-in-hand in a sense that when big companies are growing, the little ones also follow, kinda like in 2020-2021, now it seems to be the opposite

I guess is that just the difference between big companies and small ones? When hard times come, the big ones are able to adjust and recover and the smaller ones just get destroyed?

And to finish it off, how do you tell the difference between companies that have no hope and will most likely be bankrupt soon, versus those that will most likely make a comeback and recover from being down 90% or more. I feel like it could be a great time to put a little bit of money in these smaller companies but don’t really know how to tell if they’re gonna last or not

Energy Fuels $UUUU DD,"**Overview**

Energy Fuels, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the extraction, recovery, recycling, exploration, permitting, evaluation, and sale of uranium mineral properties in the United States. The company produces and sells vanadium pentoxide, rare earth elements, and heavy mineral sands such as ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and monazite.

**Explanation of Element and Mineral Importance**

**Uranium –** This is the fuel for nuclear reactors. Please see my post on Uranium if you want to understand the significance of it, and why Energy Fuels will massively benefit from it. Link Here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g51fj0/get\_in\_on\_uranium\_now/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g51fj0/get_in_on_uranium_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

 

**Vanadium** is a key component in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which are used for energy storage systems. Due to shifts toward renewable energy sources, the demand for efficient, large-scale energy storage is increasing. VRFBs are particularly suited for grid storage due to their scalability, long lifespan, and ability to discharge over a long period, making vanadium an essential material for the emerging clean energy economy. This shift represents a significant growth driver for the vanadium market as energy storage technologies become increasingly vital.

https://preview.redd.it/8jf3r5ebv93e1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9db23e3e0e6bc655f2972abc967ae3283ac808e

**SWOT on VRFBs (Guidehouse Insights)**

The nuclear energy sector represents a significant opportunity for vanadium products. Vanadium alloys are highly valuable due to their low neutron-absorption characteristics and high temperature and corrosion resistance. These properties make vanadium-based alloys ideal for use in nuclear reactors, particularly in the construction of pressure vessels and structural components. The ability of vanadium alloys to withstand the harsh operating environments inside a nuclear reactor without significant degradation, extends the service life of these components, enhancing the overall safety and efficiency of nuclear power plants.

Vanadium is also used in the aerospace industry and plays a huge role in the steel industry as well, due to its ability to enhance the strength and durability of steel.

**Rare Earth Elements (REE’s)**

**NdPr –** A combination of two rare earth elements: Neodymium (Nd) and Praseodymium (Pr). These elements are both crucial in the production of high-strength permanent magnets. Their powerful magnetic properties are essential in: Electric vehicles, wind turbines, consumer electronics, and defense technologies. Energy Fuels is one of the few US companies able to commercialize the production of separated NdPr.

**Growth Projection for REEs in Energy Transition (Source: Adamas Intelligence)**

 

**NdFeB Magnets and Why They Are Important**

Neodymium-Iron-Boron Magnets are a type of permanent magnet. They are the strongest commercially available magnet offering high magnetic strength while being lightweight and compact. With the energy transition going on, demand for these magnets is increasing significantly YoY.

https://preview.redd.it/mdzrojhdv93e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d175283f0b61f2a74352f03375ef34b359131e5d

**NdFeB Magnet Content**

As we can see in the chart, NdPr accounts for about a third of NdFeB magnets composition.

**Heavy Mineral Sands**

**Ilmenite –** Mined and processed to produce titanium oxide (TiO2). TiO2 is used in paints, coatings, and plastics which allows UUUU to diversify their revenue further into industrial areas.

**Zircon –** Used for manufacturing ceramics, refractory materials, and foundry molds. Also used in the medical industry for things like dental and orthopedic implants, and for PET imaging which is used for cancer diagnostics.

**Rutile –** Similar to ilmenite, rutile has a superior quality of titanium content making it more valuable.

**Monazite –** A rare mineral that contains rare-earth elements and uranium. Used as a feedstock by Energy Fuels in their processing endeavors. NdPr is extracted from Monazite as well as the minerals mentioned above.

https://preview.redd.it/s4y482vev93e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=29e6c68d972ac33b6d0b22506f6c5168fb1f924a

**White Mesa Mill**

·         100% owned by Energy Fuels, is the only facility in the USA able to process Monazite to produce REE’s.

·         The only fully licensed and operating conventional uranium mill in the US.

·         Completed “Phase 1” REE facility with up to 1,000 tonnes of separated NdPr production capacity.

·         Largest producer of Vanadium in the US. (Production on standby currently due to low prices, strong inventory on hand.

In the next year, I believe we will see positive EBITDA due to mines becoming operational, instead of sitting idle.

**Q3 2024 Highlights**

·         Very good balance sheet with over $180 million of liquidity and no debt.

·         Uranium prices continue to drive revenue. Sold 50,000 pounds of U3O8 at spot price of $80. Proceeds totaling $4 million, gross profit margin of 54%.

·         New long-term uranium contract. Expected delivery of 270,000-330,000 pounds between 2026 and 2027.

·         Produced 38 tonnes of separated NdPr at White Mesa Mill.

·         NdPr produced at White Mesa is currently being qualified with permanent magnet manufactures and other potential customers, setting the stage for growth.

·         Strong uranium inventory consisting of 235,000 pounds finished U3O8. 805,000 pounds of U3O8 in ore and raw materials. Expects inventory to continue increasing due to mining operations.

·         A large vanadium inventory of 905,000 pounds finished V2O5.

**Acquisition of RadTran LLC**

On August 19^(th), 2024, Energy Fuels announced it acquired RadTran, a private company specializing in the separation of critical radioisotopes. Since 2021, Energy Fuels and RadTran have been working together to evaluate the feasibility of recovering radium-226 and radium-228 from uranium processing at White Mesa Mill. These recovered isotopes would be made available to the pharmaceutical industry and others to enable the production of acintium-225 and lead-212. These isotopes are critical components in the development of targeted alpha therapies which offer promising new treatments for various cancers. There is currently a global shortage of Ra-226 and Ra-228, therefore limiting the supply of Ac-225 and Pb-212. This is a huge acquisition for Energy Fuels as medical isotopes possess immense demand.

**Acquisition of Base Resources**

On October 2^(nd), 2024, Energy Fuels announced the completion of its acquisition of Base Resources. This is expected to transform the company into a global leader in critical mineral production, including titanium, zirconium, REEs, and uranium. This is huge for the company as they brought in world class management and operations capability while gaining ownership over the Toliara Project in Madagascar. This is widely considered by industry experts to be one of the best HMS (heavy mineral sands) projects in the world.

**Conclusion**

I think this is a company with massive potential to be a large player in the supply chain for Vanadium and REEs. With a stockpile of 905,000 pounds of V2O5, they are easily able to capitalize on growing demand. They are also in a great position to capitalize on the growing domestic market for uranium, as we continuously rely less on foreign nations. With 235,000 pounds of inventory on hand and a production capability of 1.1-1.4 million pounds of U3O8 per year, the company will be able to profit from further spot sales and long-term contracts. With strategic acquisitions of Base Resources and RadTran, the company clearly demonstrates commitment to growth and innovation. At a current price of **$6.90**, I believe within 2 years this company will triple in price to around **$20**.",11,5,1732638398.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h0fvp9/energy_fuels_uuuu_dd/

What's the logic behind .DJSOEP (Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Exploration & Production Index)？,".DJSOEP reflects the performance of companies involved in oil and gas exploration and production. Its top 3 holdings are ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources, Inc. and Marathon Petroleum Corporation.

Here's my guess about this index. Please correct it.

1, There is a significant correlation between .DJSOEP and oil price.

[.DJSOEP](https://preview.redd.it/e2lfuvquw73e1.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e605a6f93689eb21b6b4ef6e470867765306ba6)

2, Oil mining output declines, Oil prices rise, oil companies' profits increase, company stock prices rise, and the index rises. The less oil mining, the higher this index is, explaining why it performs better under Biden administration.

3, Trump is preparing to increase oil drilling, plus with the OPEC preparing to increase production, and with the wars in the Middle East coming to an end, oil prices will decline after 2025, so this index will also remain low after 2025.",1,2,1732615445.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h08g70/whats_the_logic_behind_djsoep_dow_jones_us_select/

"AI Spending Isn’t Slowing Down, the Mag 7 Stocks Are Still the Best Bet","Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, aren't going to stop pouring billions into chatbots.  



Although Nvidia saw a dip due to high market expectations, the long-term outlook for AI remains strong, with chip sales still showing impressive growth. While there’s competition from AMD, the overall demand for AI chips is skyrocketing.  



The Mag 7 remains the key growth driver for AI. Analysts predict these companies will keep growing, with capital spending expected to surge by double digits, reaching nearly $300 billion by 2027 (according to FactSet). Nvidia benefits from chip demand, while Meta drives revenue through advertising.



And even though the Mag 7 has outperformed the market (twice the S&P 500's gains), their valuations are still reasonable—around 27 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, down from over 30 times earlier this year, and near the middle of their historical range (according to Evercore).  



So, in short, keep holding on! ",18,2,1732612471.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h07sc3/ai_spending_isnt_slowing_down_the_mag_7_stocks/

• **Strong earnings:** Q3 revenue jumped 26% YoY to $2.16B, and EPS crushed expectations at $0.64.

• **Expansion:** Shopify is gaining ground in new markets and industries.

• **Innovation:** Investments in AI and data centers are boosting its capabilities.

• **Analyst upgrades:** Several have moved $SHOP to a “Strong Buy.”

The company’s future looks bright, but high valuations and competition are worth watching. Are you holding $SHOP, or is it time to take profits?

Did anyone see what happened to quantum computing stocks this week?,"I was browsing stocks on Robinhood last week and ran a saved search that I always use (down daily 20% stocks) and I saw QUBT and QBTS on there and I started doing some research on them. 

Recently, I have decided to move to long term positions and I have been very bullish on space stocks like LUNR and RKLB. I genuinely feel like space will be the fastest growing sector over the next decade. Anyway, I went home that night, watched a few videos on some cool stuff in quantum computing and said screw it, I think I’m long on quantum computing. It seriously will change our world dramatically when we inevitably figure it out. So I thought it was a deal, dumped a few grand into QUBT, QBTS, RGTI and IONQ. 

Apparently, I just had amazing timing because this past week has apparently been great for quantum. Researchers have figured out an important milestone in controlling qubits and Amazon announced that they were investing $4B into their own quantum computer. D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) cracked a standardized encryption on a binary computer a few days ago too. There’s been some big steps in the right direction on quantum lately.

investment advice,"

Looking for some advice.

  
I am 44 years old and I have been casually saving over the past few years and had my money in a high-interest savings account that was getting 5.25% I saved up about 16k so far and I was hoping to make more than 50 dollars a month interest. I have moved the money out of the high-yield account, transferred it into my fidelity account, and bought into a mutual fund FCNTX. My ultimate goal is to double it over the next few years and use that money to buy a car. Should I leave it in the mutual fund or put it into an ETF?

2nd question, I have a 401k that I had with an old employer and have 150k total which is currently invested in 50% Fidelity 500 index (FXAIX) and 50% in Jp Morgan Large Cap Growth (JLGMX). Should I leave it where I have it? YTD performance is 24% and has done well over the past few years. Last year it was 30+ %. Again I have read a lot of people saying to invest in ETFs.

Google on the run or Google on the run?,"Can we talk about google for a second? Everyone keeps touting it as a good deal right now - assuming that Google will always rebound. But 90% (or so) of Google's income comes from their search business - which is slowly dying. 

As a digital native I've worked a lot with Google's products and I've used google like everyone else to an extent where it is part of my everyday life. But now... Not so much. I have to admit - I'm finding myself searching very rarely. Yeah, I'm using maps and gmail and so on - but the moat on those businesses is not very high. My gut - as their core consumer - is telling me that I don't need google as much as I used to. And honestly, for the first time every where I've actively reflected on it - I totally can imagine a world without google.

So, I'm not so sure we are going back to an all dominant Google again, and instead of assuming that Google will be the mastodont forever, I can more rationally imagine a scenario where the business slowly adapts into niches over time. Think Kodak etc.

Gold vs property vs BTC/Crypto,"Context/brief personal background:

I’m about 30, bought a new house, have been investing in stocks, pay into a 401k, pension, and a small savings account, make almost 100k annually and have no inheritance or trusts or any type of money coming from family previously and probably little to none in inheritance. 

I’m trying to continue diversifying my portfolio to safely retire, and give my children flexibility in their futures, which has lead me to contemplate my next move, hence the title.

Property: I own property currently, I understand that historically property is probably the safest/highest yielding investment, and even passive income option. 
I worry long term (not necessarily my lifetime but maybe my children’s) that if natural resources, in this case property, became scarce that the government/banks could easily squeeze middle class people like myself out of our property via property taxes and/or interest rates, making it maybe a low probability of volatility, but very possible.
Short term investments in property such as rentals aren’t a consideration for the sake of this conversation. 1) because I’m simply opposed to the idea and its implications but 2) because to reiterate, I’m trying to plan deep into the future for my children with the consideration exponential wealth disparity, and natural resource scarcity. 

Bitcoin: BTC fundamentally seems ridiculous to me. I’m not arguing that people can, have, and will continue to profit off BTC. You can’t argue realized gains, but it has no intrinsic value. You could create any finite medium, and people do with other crypto currencies all the time, but like any fiat currency it’s only useful if a government/any body of power/authoritarian is backing it and 2) has the power to mandate/enforce it. Why would they switch from useless paper, to useless software? Why is bitcoin more valuable than an NFT, or any other limited piece digital media that can’t be duplicated? 
It seems like a blatant pyramid scheme and I’m genuinely baffled it’s taken so seriously by so many. 

Gold: is kind of where I’m leaning.
It is finite, it has intrinsic value, longest historical value, and I personally feel this is a genuinely one of the most effective ways to insulate yourself from hyper predatory capitalist. 

Middle class people attempting to hoard property as an investment directly hurts other middle and lower class people because it limits supply and increases demand of a vital resource. Not only is property needed for shelter but it’s also people’s biggest chunk of savings towards their inevitable retirement when they can downsize into a place that can comfortably die. 
Investing in gold on the other hand only impedes industrialists, and still yields personal gains. 

Summary: in this thought experiment assume we know in 50-100 years we have the wealth disparity akin to feudalism, the technology of tomorrow, and a monopoly of all natural resources - what do you invest in now? 

I know my bias is clear, I promise I’m not here to troll people, insult your intelligence, or critique your morality. 
If you have polar opposite feelings and investments as me, I still very much want to hear your opinion on why I’m wrong or what I’m missing. 

All I want is to protect my kids from the future.

The difference between a 3 month and 12 month emergency fund,"Lets say your monthly expenses are $6k. So like a responsible adult you listen to the advice given by financial advisors who say you should have an emergency fund of 6-12 months.

So being extra conservative you do 12 months for a total of $72k a year. You feel a bit of comfort knowing you could survive many emergencies. But is this really a wise move mathematically?

Person A has a 12 month emergency fund in a HYSA. $72k. After 5 years that $72k gets about 4% interest a year. It will grow to $88k. Barely beating inflation.

Person B has a 3 month emergency fund of $18k. The extra $60k he puts into VOO. After 5 years it is now $125k.

Person A basically lost $37k because he was so conservative with his emergency fund. But its worse if you look at reality the last 5 years. You couldn’t get 4% on HYSA until recently. And inflation was worse than 4%. So Person A probably lost close to $50k because of having a large emergency fund.

It gets worse. What if the emergency fund was for 10 years in VOO:

12 month fund after 10 years - $84,000

3 month fund after 10 years - $170,000

After 15 years:

12 month: $90k

3 month: $374k

You are literally throwing away hundreds of thousands of dollars down the drain if you have an oversized emergency fund. 

I’m going to be honest. Personally I have had a 12 month fund for over a decade. I basically threw away $100k for no reason. For those 10 years I never had to use my emergency fund even with layoffs and unexpected large expenses. 

The lesson is don’t think having a too big emergency fund isn’t a problem. Over 20 years you could lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

I’m not saying no one should have a 12 month fund. I’m not saying everyone should have a 3 month fund. It depends on my many factors how many months you need. But don’t fall in the same trap I did thinking that more is better. No it isn’t.

SMCI looking like a comeback kid story right about now ,"SMCI golden age and beautiful chart. 

After hours Friday SMCI jumped almost 9 percent! Makes perfect sense that investors are flooding back into this stock! It has been so beaten down over the last six months by bad press and fears of fraud. Those fears have been quelled by a new CFO and auditing team. 

We just saw in the last month of 72% rally and there is still plenty of room to run on Monday it will open up around $48, the last critical level we saw was $49.

Also, it looks like a somewhat sloppy cup and handle pattern is forming. My half baked technical analysis is. We will see a minor pull back around $50 to finish the pattern, then it will launch back up to the next critical level around $60 a share. 

Fundamentally speaking, they have been showing plenty of growth and demand for their products which mainly consists of hardware to House semiconductors, especially their trademark marked water cooled rack, which directly addresses a huge issue that centers are facing as computing power gets to Skynet levels. Their price to earnings ratio is a modest 21.9, the earnings per share is a humble 2, the ps ratio is 1.5 which is the lowest among its competitors. In fact all of its metrics or lowest amongst its competitors except for the EPS for AMD, which is 1.1. 

There will be much to see within the next quarterly earnings report and how they managed to address their auditing issues and reporting issues. But I think this company still has room to run and definitely has legs.

I have 200 shares with plans to buy much more. I was going to buy on the next red day, expecting it to be Monday, but I digress. Next pull back I’m buying calls with a strike price of about $49-$55 exp in March. Even considering a YOLO. God Speed to the investors and traders.

Suddenly inherited 100k at 20. Is it a bad idea to combine s&p500 and emerging markets and ignore all world?,"Long story short, I'm 20 and inherited 100k from a close family member. I'm trying to figure out which percentage to put into the s&p500, the all world or emerging markets.

I'm from Austria and based on our sinking birth rates and burdensome welfare systems and unsustainable pension schemes in the EU I'm kind of pessimistic about Europe compared to the US and emerging markets (for example India with its massive and much younger population). My thoughts are that if if anything beats the US economy in the next decades, it obviously won't be Europe, and that Europe will underperform/recede compared to other economies like India. The same goes for Japan, especially with their pervasive anti-immigration attitudes which puts an even stronger pressure on their dismal birth rate.

Question regarding capital loss carry-forward time limit ,"Hi all, I was recently going over some of my old tax returns and discovered that I had a significant amount of capital loss on my 2003 tax return (result of the internet bubble crash) that I never used at all in the subsequent years. This happened because I switched tax preparers, and I was also not active in the market for a while after. I never applied the 2003 carry forward loss to offset any gains or even take $3000 against earned income in the years after 2003. I want to use this amount this year and going forward if possible. 

I researched it online and it says that capital loss carry forward does not expire until fully used. However, my tax preparer said that I lost $3000 from that amount every year after 2003 even though it was never actually applied. That basically means I lost $60k from that amount ($3000 x 20 years). I can offset the rest of the amount this year against my gains and continue to carry forward the balance if anything remains. I called the IRS customer service line, and they couldn't help at all. They basically said to go into an IRS center to find an answer. Do you think my tax preparer is correct and I lost $3k every year after or what I read online is correct and the entire amount is still available?

Retirement investing Q: Target Date Fund vs Index Mix,"Hi folks! I'm 33 y/o and plan to work until \~65, so still early on in my working career. I'm taking advantage of my employer matching retirement contributions and contributing >15% each month. When I first started at my current job (4 yrs ago) I picked a Target date (Vanguard target 2055) fund for all of my investments without giving it a lot of thought. Now I'm looking at the performance of this target date fund compared to their regular index fund options (S&P large cap, mid, small, intl).

The large and mid cap indexes seem to be handily outperforming the target date fund over every time frame (1yr, 3yr, 5yr, 10yr), while the small cap has been fairly similar and the international index has been worse. While none of the fees on these funds are outrageous, the US based index fund fees are still a fraction of the target date fees (.02 and .015 vs .065 with the target date). 

Since I'm still early on in my career with lots of time to ride out the market ups and downs, I'm wondering if it would be better to move from the target date fund and into these indexes to take advantage of the lower fees. The target date allocation is 54% domestic stock, 35% international stock and 11% bonds/cash. At this point in my career, I don't feel like I need to have anything in bonds/cash. If I were to spread out my money between large, mid and small cap US indexes and the international index, would this not be diversified in a similar way to the target date fund (with the exception of bonds/cash)? 

Obviously the downside is that I have to decide when to move back into more conservative holdings as I get later into my career. But if I decided I wanted to have this managed for me when I'm in my 50s, couldn't I just move back into the 2055 target date fund at that time?

What's stopping me from investing all my money?,"I always hear from people that you want a certain percentage of your money in liquid cash in case for emergencies. But does that still really hold true in 2024? I have never really come across emergencies where I suddenly needed more than a couple thousand which I can easily just put on my credit card. My credit card limit is something like 25k but even if it was 10k: when would I be in a situation that I needed to pay a 10k+ bill on the spot? Being my boring frugal ass self, this would never really happen. Hospital bills for example do not need to be paid for right away.

The only situation I can think of is, for some reason, you are in a different country, stuck in the middle of nowhere, and you have to pay some business cash for some reason. But even in 3rd world countries (having been to many myself), credit card payment systems are basically universal, and I never had issues with needing cash. And even then, you would obviously want to plan your cash liquidity before some kind of major trip like that to a remote part of the world.

So my question is: what is stopping me from:

A) putting a majority of my money (60-70%) into stocks and then

B) putting the rest into the highest possible interest return accounts (Aka T-Bills, high return CDs/money market) that return better than high interest savings accounts but are obviously less liquid.

If presumably, the market is still frothy in the Spring, I would be foolish to dump that lump sum into the market, correct? I would want to spread it out over a period of time?   Would it be wise to hold that in some relatively secure position where I get some modest but reliable growth and gradually invest it into more equities?

Is the stock market a bit of a Pyramid scheme?,"Does anybody else think there is an element of Pyramid scheme in the whole stock market?

Of course everybody understands that businesses have real value -- both through their assets and their future cash flows. So holding stocks is holding real value.



But recently, the valuations of the whole market have been more and more decoupled from the underlying value.  The S&P 500 P/E is at 30, which has been exceeded historically only four times (1999, 2001, 1009, 2021). Taking the inverse, it means a 3.3% earrnings yield. SPY dividend yield is 1.5%.

[https://www.gurufocus.com/economic\_indicators/57/sp-500-pe-ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/57/sp-500-pe-ratio)

Compared to bonds, this is terrible. Which means stock gains are mainly driven by capital appreciation. While business growth is a thing, it'd be hard for business earnings growth to be in line with expected stock value growth.



Stock prices are determined by supply and demand. Supply of publicly traded stock of ""good"", successful businesses is limited. Demand is ever growing through availability of capital, because of wider use of 401k, more international investors banking on the S&P500 and loose money policy by the Fed.

And since everybody says that stocks go up over long term, historically, everybody considers VOO\* a safe long-term investment for their capital.



The question I ask myself: How much of that is perception and self-fulfilling prophecy, how much of it is based on ""intrinsic real value growth"" and how sustainable is this?

If everybody just keeps doing this because they think it's a good investment, this can be a self-reinforcing cycle for a long time (see: Bitcoin). I don't want to repeat the clichee of a ""bubble"", which implies that it has to burst soon. This cycle can go on easily for another decade or two. 



So...what do you guys think -- is there a chance that, long-term, stocks can decouple from their underlying fundamentals in ways not seen in the past?



(\*some may say: ""ETFs are at fault, don't buy into S&P500, but take your chances with lesser known stock""; but that's not the point: If demand for stocks as a whole is too big to be kept in check, then the money has to flow somewhere, and that affects even smaller caps for niche investors).",0,31,1733561380.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h8og11/is_the_stock_market_a_bit_of_a_pyramid_scheme/
Under the premise that we will see a crash within 12 months - what do you think will trigger it? ,"Had a good read in https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/s/zogDExW8Wt discussing if we see a similar situation than back in the dot-com era. 
Now I'm in the camp of those thinking markets are overvalued (especially in context of the (global) economic situation) and that we will see a crash or at least a massive correction soon. 

I admit that I'm waiting for this crash for quite some time already an until now it has just cost me returns as I was underinvested. So I'm ready to accept that I am just a bad investor ;) 

I still think it will happen within 12 months and if we stick to this hypothesis for this discussion - what do you think might trigger the downturn?

"Meaning of ROI, when it is a statistic on a stock","Hello, what is the meaning of ROI, when it is a statistic on a stock? I understand in general what ROI Is, but how is it calculated in that context?

<p>Maybe it is the ROI if you bought the IPO on day one?

<p>I mean, it is pretty obvious how you get ROI (return on investment), generally speaking.  You take the current value of the investment, and then divide by the cost basis, and then come up with an annualized percentage, right?  Like, if the ROI on Willis Towers Watson is 16% (actual stat), then it means you earned an annualized return of 16% on the stock.

<p>Cool.  But then I wonder, what is the time frame here?  Does this mean I got into the IPO, and bought the stock right away when it opened that day?  Is ROI calculated from that?

<p>Or, maybe it is something else, like the return over the past year, or the past five years.  It's just not clear to me.

"COVID as a Mini ""Lost Decade""","By overlaying earnings and market cap we can get a pretty rough story of what happened with COVID and money printing and interest rate hikes and what this means for the future.

This image below is a bunch of large companies that represent the SPY. The colored areas are their earnings (with their predicted earnings in a lighter shade) and the black line is their combined market cap (price).

[https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02](https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02)  
I've annotated a few arrows to explain what seems to have roughly happened.

**Orange Arrow 2020 - 2022:** Interest rates drop which causes excess liquidity to flood the market. Those who already had assets saw huge portfolio increases. This new wealth combined with low interest caused a housing price boom. New money in the hands of retail caused cults to form around memes like GME. Plus no one wants to work and is wfh.

**Red Arrow 2022:** A ""lost decade"" is a period of time where new investors have no access to good investments. People who just started working in 2022 or decided to start investing in 2022 had no good place to put their money and would only have broken even in 2024. (the horizontal dash). In a larger crisis like with Japan's lost decade(s) you have 10-20 years where the stock market effectively grinds sideways. 

**Red & Orange**

[https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb](https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb)

If you overlay the SPY with the Fed's interest rate policy you can see that it looks to have caused some temporary price distress but long term the price is correlated with earnings, not interest rate.  A ""lost decade"" is effectively exuberance that ""pulls forward"" price appreciation and ""steals"" it from future investors. 

In the COVID response, those who had assets in 2020 benefited while those who started investing in 2022 had a difficult time b/c they didn't have access to the exponential growth of markets.

**Blue Line**

Long term investors who think in decades and don't actually need large purchases like cars or weddings (like old people...) can just ignore these bumps and focus on long term earnings.

\---

The above is obviously over-simplified but it's an example of how using earnings and price in tandem allows you to see the underlying story behind price movement.

If you just focus on price, all you can do is draw a line up and the right and say things that are true like ""AAPL is a good company""

[https://imgur.com/a/5L07X9p](https://imgur.com/a/5L07X9p)

You have no perspective.

The worst example is someone who got scared of investing in stocks in 2020 but seeing everyone around him get rich for 2 years he decides to start investing in 2022 and loses money for two years and decides to stop and then starts watching everyone around him make more money... in a never-ending spiral of 2 year delayed FOMO.

Roth vs Trad Vanguard / Confirmation,"Hey everyone. Yet another Traditional vs Roth question so thanks for bearing with me. I believe I received conflicting info from the Vanguard rep over the phone earlier in the year and, even after reading link after link, I want to get clarification since I missed one pivotal piece. 

Background:

Have a Roth Account.
Have a Traditional IRA. 
Contribute 7k+ per year into a Traditional IRA and then convert that to a Roth each year (?) 

My question:
Vanguard told me to contribute each month to my Traditional Ira and then at the start of the year I “convert it” to my Roth IRA. Is that right? That’s not the Backdoor Roth but does that matter?

Also, if I contribute more than the 7k in the traditional IRA, I can only “convert” 7k of that to the Roth, and leave any overage in the Traditional with the stocks I have set?

Thoughts on SPYT? Highly ambitious plan or doomed to fail?,"Hoping someone can shed some light on this. I have an older family member who recently took the advice of his financial advisor and moved about 100k of his 650k savings into SPYT to draw income from that. He told me about this because he wanted my thoughts, and honestly I know so little about CC ETFs that I don't even want to say anything to him. It got me very curious though. The fund plan is to return 20% with no NAV erosion. This seems a whole lot like it's too good to be true - even acknowledging that it may not work - just suggesting that they can return 20% consistently seems almost like heresy to me. Given that 99% of my experience investing is in long term buy/hold until I retire type of stuff, I've googled and read some and I understand WHAT they're doing, just really don't know enough to guess on what that'll mean for investors.

Can someone shed a little light on this particular fund's claim and tell me what they think? I don't own any, and don't plan to own any, I'm just super curious about the idea of DRIP-ing something with a 20% return and no loss of principle and how likely the fund is to succeed.

Why I’m likely to Capitulate and buy Bitcoin,"I’m a big fundamental guy with stocks. Hate technicals.

Bitcoin is something I’ve never owned and basically swore off.

With it hitting $100k a coin, it made me think. Okay here is a thing valued at $2-3 trillion with no fundamental value.

It’s totally based on belief, kinda like Santa or whatever. Then I thought about the last 3 years with crypto companies defrauding investors, it tanking and still it came back. 

It just went through probably one of the largest questioning of faith ever and people still believe to the tune of new all time highs.

What could cause an even greater loss in faith than defrauding billions from people? With more regulations coming it will likely better legitimize crypto causing more belief.

Rocks, art and unbuildable land all have value even though they don’t produce cash flows.

Bitcoin is self fulfilling, it has value only because people believe it has value and it seems like that isn’t going to go away anytime soon. Cash in and of itself doesn’t have value, but because we accept it, it does. People are accepting bitcoin more.

If I am going to buy, it will be a small amount each month and DCA rather than allocate a block of my portfolio.",0,88,1733505697.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h86j2c/why_im_likely_to_capitulate_and_buy_bitcoin/

That said, over the last year or two, it has certainly gained a ton of legitimacy as it has played a significant role in Trump’s presidential campaign and also begun to be an asset that hedge funds are also purchasing.

I, like many others I assume, want to make it a part of my portfolio, but it’s tough to analyze its value because it doesn’t act like your usually security exchanged on the stock market. There are no balance sheets or income statements for bitcoin to look at, and I have no idea if its valuation is way too high or too low.

I can certainly see it continuing to go up in the near to mid term future. If you told me it would hit $200k in the next two years, I wouldn’t be surprised. That said, I also wouldn’t be surprised if it also hit $40k in the next two years too.

Is now a good time to buy? There’s a lot of hype around it after it just hit $100k in value, so I’m nervous about jumping into it right now, but I’m struggling to put together a fair value estimate that I should wait for it to hit before I buy.

What are your thoughts on this matter?

Beyond Meat (BYND) - Developing Support/Reversal,"While I typically avoid securities having high/excessively Short Interest, BYND appears to be ready to reverse the momentum & begin an upswing.  Having a suite of new products, improving financials, and an updated marketing plan....they seem to be poised for a turnaround (likely in the short term).  With this amount of Short Interest, this stock could very easily spike, if the shorts find themselves scrambling to cover through a rising stock price.

Best use of $200k inheritance,"Hello all, I'm a 39 year old living in the US. I was making $75k/yr up until 3 years ago when it got downgraded to $35k/yr (closure of company due to COVID and I needed/need a job to support the family). I currently own a condo, but have $180k at 4.25% interest rate left on the loan (monthly on that is ~$1.3k and value of home is ~$600k-650k, ~$420k-470k in equity). My monthly expenses average about $4k/mth and I have $90k in the bank (so I am using my net income of $2k/mth combined with $2k/mth from my savings account for expenses). I need to go back to school to be able to make more money, still deciding on what I'm going to do (either nursing or accounting, I am currently in the medical field). Here is where it gets a bit more interesting: I am going to come into an inheritance in the amount of roughly $200k.

I have invested in stocks throughout the years, but am scared of the volatility. I have had familial investment properties that I've managed and that's not what I'm interested in (at least not for the near future). I don't gamble, I like sure things. This is the reason my money is in a regular savings account with BofA earning like 0.0001% interest per year (I know it's useless, but once again to reiterate, I don't like to gamble).

I would like to upgrade the condo to a house within the next 5 years (with the caveat that I understand that with safe investing the $200k will not become $1 million, but I also don't want it to turn into $200,015 in a BofA account).

I know this post is all over the place, but ultimately I want to know what to do with the $200k. Obviously, I need the $90k savings for my day to day until I get up on my feet career wise (which is why I don't really want to invest that), but I want to invest the $200k inheritance. I don't know if I should just pay off my loan, invest in HYSA, bonds, dividends, etc (I know nothing about any investment accounts other than basic savings accounts, CD's, IRA's, I read about Vanguard in another post today and would have to look into that).

Any thoughts would be appreciated, thank you!",0,25,1733499747.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h84752/best_use_of_200k_inheritance/

28M Retirment vs Taxable Account Question,"Hi all - I am 28 and have about 250k in my multiple retirement accounts. That breaks down as; 130k in Trad IRA (rolled over old 401k), current 401k 25k, and 90k Roth IRA. I am currently contributing 13% + 5%match to 401k and Roth IRA max. My question is the following; 

Compared it my retirement savings I am relatively light on cash. I do have an emergency fund for \~3months and I share a taxable account with my fiancé which is at 50k. I want to start saving for a downpayment on a house. BUT, I live in a VHCOL area and use my 401k to save money on taxes. Should I start to take a large hit on taxes so that I can slowly filter more money into a taxable account to use as a downpayment on a house?

Some contexts - My current job pays about 130k, which for where I live is not that cushiony. Depending on the month, I don't end up with anything left over for non-retirement savings. Most of my savings come from my years living in a LCOL area with a higher salary and basically saving 75% of my earnings.

IOT: A Potential Dip-Buying Opportunity?,"Last night, Samsara (Ticker: IOT) reported earnings that comfortably beat both EPS and revenue expectations. Despite strong performance, the stock fell over 10% after hours. As the market said: “Cool, but your Q4 guidance is $0.8M shy of what we wanted, so here’s a **10% drop in your stock price** for your troubles.”

**What Does Samsara Do?**  
Samsara provides sensors and cloud-based software to help manage vehicle fleets and industrial operations. Their Internet of Things (IoT) platform enables GPS tracking, monitors routes, assesses vehicle performance, and now includes cutting-edge AI-powered safety features.

**Earnings Highlights:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 36% YoY.
* **Large Customer Expansion:** Increased share of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) from large customers ($100k+ ARR contracts).

**So Why the Drop?**  
Apparently, Wall Street got hung up on guidance. Samsara revised its Q4 revenue target to a midpoint of $335M, which is… drumroll… **$0.8M less than analysts expected.**

Yes, the company that just grew revenue by 36% is being punished for rounding down. This modest adjustment led to a **$3 billion market cap wipeout.**

**Why I’m Still Buying:**

1. **Big Moves Up-Market:** Samsara is snagging bigger clients and expanding internationally, showing they’ve got staying power.
2. **Innovation FTW:** Their AI-powered **Drowsiness Detection** (launched in October) uses **38 billion minutes of video training** to spot tired drivers. Yawning? Head-nodding? Face-rubbing? Samsara knows, and they’ll tell you (and your boss). It’s next-gen safety tech that can save lives and dollars.
3. **Consistently Outperforming:** This is a company that has a habit of beating its own guidance. Personally, I’d bet they’ll do it again.

The way I see it, this stock drop is a classic case of Wall Street overreacting to decimal places.  Samsara’s story—international expansion, innovative products, and solid execution—remains intact. I am of the opinion that represents a good buy opportunity of a stock I'm a long term fan of, would love to hear others take on the company and if i missed anything!",0,1,1733492786.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h81owq/iot_a_potential_dipbuying_opportunity/

What is your thought on my portfolio and strategy?,"I'm 30M. I recently started investing in ETF & individual stocks. Below is my portfolio I figured it out myself, but I am not sure if it is reasonable in the long run, and I want to hear other people's opinions, comments, and criticism on it.

**ETF 75%**

**Individual stocks 25%**  
\- **Tech Growth 12%:** Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Palantir, Nvidia, Tesla

\- **Consumer defensive 3%:** UnitedHealth, Mastercard, Cola  
\- **Personal favorite 3.5%:** Garmin, Air Product and Chemicals, Walmart, Rolls-Royce, Airbus  
\- **Aerospace & Defensive 1.5%**: Rocket Lab, Howmet, RTX Corp

The reason that my portfolio contains more than 20 stocks is that I want to diversify it in terms of the stocks, not types of assets. 

My concerns/questions are:

1. I'm not sure if I hold too many stocks in the same category (e.g. tech stocks) and most of them are already covered by the IWDA ETF.
2. I'm also considering holding only 1 or 2 high-dividend stocks like AbbVie, instead of 5 dividend stocks. Is it a good idea?
3. My long-term plan follows ""time in the market > timing the market"". So I plan to split DCA in half and put in ETF and stocks equally. I also read about the [Enhanced DCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b40399/enhanced_dollar_cost_averaging/). Statistically, is the Enhanced DCA worth a try?

Why is saving for retirement as a business owner so complicated?,"This is more of a rant than anything. 

I’ve been in business a little over 2 years and I’m *finally* to the point where investing in a retirement account through the business is smart. I can deduct the contributions and finally start putting cash away for the long term. Win win! 

I go and setup my retirement account through Fidelity, add my bank account and it asks me if I am using a business checking to contribute. I click ‘yes’ and proceed through the prompts. 

Long story short, they want me to send in a form through USPS with all of my business checking and routing numbers attached (no way..) They also want a voided check attached to that form. 

Maybe I’m overreacting, but I feel like this should be much easier than what it is.

My biggest fear for 2025 is declines becoming contagious if one part of the economy hiccups,"When has this not been a risk, it's why the economy acts as a ratchet, going up slow but down fast. But 2025 seems particularly risky IMO because of the valuations, on well, everything. Stocks, real estate, crypto, gov't debt. None of them on their own pose any catastrophic problems in isolation, but what happens to all of them together when there's a hiccup?

There's an article in the Economics forum about commercial real estate woes. By itself it's not the end of the world, but with the gov't debt where it's at, dropping fed rates back to 0 with bank failures won't have the same effect cause bond vigilantes will ramp up the 10 year. If stocks fall, what happens to home prices when they are both at all time highs? In 2008 they both went down. What if stocks fall then crypto freaks then stocks fall more? What is this going to do to AI if funding slows? What if they all fall a little bit and that cycle repeats? The biggest safegap seems to be rich people holding a ton of cash, but they aren't necessarily going to 'catch a falling knife'.

To me, the most insulated assets to protect for this seem to be international equity. Prices are comparatively low lessening the air gap and in an actively deglobalizing world the correlation should be minimizing.

Can you have Edward Jones account with no AUM?,"My friend’s dad has a decently large account at Edward Jones and claims he doesn’t pay any fees at all (no AUM, no annual fees, etc.) except 2.5% on any purchase of a fund/stock and 2.5% on any sale of a purchase. Is this possible there are no other fees at all? Would Edward Jones accommodate a fee structure like that? That’s not a 1-1.5% AUM type fee?

To be clear, I still don’t support these fees when you can trade for free on your own but I had just never heard of a pay structure like this at EJ? Does that sound right/possible?

Thanks!",2,6,1733428098.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h7hywn/can_you_have_edward_jones_account_with_no_aum/
"SGOV questions, mid December dividend","Hi I have a few questions about SGOV.

What is the underlying price? Is it $100?

What determines the price? It is not supply/demand like other stocks. Today it is 100.37, I understand it increases as we near the dividend date, and the price reflects the expected dividend. But if the underlying price is $100, why does it start every month this year at roughly $100.30, except for the 1st of January.

In 2022 on Dec. 15, there was a $0.327 dividend.

In 2023 on Dec. 14, there was a $0.455 dividend.

Will there be a dividend mid month this month?

If so, what is the date of record required to receive it?

Will the price reset closer to $100 come Jan. 1, 2025?

Thanks",5,8,1733427629.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h7hs9q/sgov_questions_mid_december_dividend/
It’s Hard To Recover From A Loss ,"This anecdotal story explains why it is hard to recover from a loss. It’s just math. A 50% loss requires a subsequent gain of 100% to get even. Again, it’s just math. Hopefully this personal account will make an impression….dump your losers early, and take profits.

Need opinions on this company : MDA Space Ltd,"So Im a french canadian from Quebec and I was looking for space and energy stocks and found this company MDA Space Ltd and found it interresting amid the rising interest into the space race. 

They are supposedly going to be able to build satellites pretty quickly by the end of 2025 and already have what I think are solid financials. They aim to be in the space and robotics sectors but its pretty much all I know about them. 

I watched this documentary on bloomberg 24/7 about many countries and companies wanting to develop their own constellation so im thinking about going long on them. 

So I was wondering if anyone know about them or if anyone with better knowledge on investing would be interested of looking them out and giving their input.

Selling losing positions to redeploy funds in a bull market. ,"I have a couple positions that I'd really like to get out of. I'd hoped they would rebound, and they may still, but they have been underperforming the market. 

I am torn between waiting for them to rebound and selling them or selling now and redeploying the funds in better investments and/or just putting the money in the S&P 500.

As I'm likely overthinking the matter I needed to write this out and hopefully get some productive feedback. 

If it helps, the positions in question are $CZR which has gotten me nowhere over the last 2.5 years and $HCA which I'm up about 22% in the last year and a half. The later is a very small position and had been performing better but has gone down in recent months.

Best strategy for RMD withdrawals ,"I have an inherited IRA account post-CARES act, so I have to withdraw the entire balance by 2032.  

I am also a California resident, and get hit with the income tax with any withdraw.

My financial planner had the strategy to draw it down 10% a year and then reinvest the withdraws in a brokerage account, which seems like a decent strategy.

My question however is if would be better tax-wise to defer withdraws until closer to the mandatory withdraw date then change state residency to a no-income tax state.  

We had planned to move anyway from California for retirement because we don’t want to get gouged by the state on our 401ks, so would just be doing this early.

So basically:

Take the 10% withdraws now paying state & federal, OR defer until closer to 2032, change residencies and only pay federal.  ",1,15,1733423705.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h7g7gk/best_strategy_for_rmd_withdrawals/
Home equity from a paid off home. ,"Hello all,

What would be the best use of equity on a paid off home? Roughly $150,00 - $200,000. 
I am looking for suggestions/information on potential investment strategies for generating new funds with these funds. Preferably low risk/minimal risk ideas but open to hearing all suggestions. 
I am located in Florida if that makes a difference. 
My initial thought was possibly using the funds to purchase a second home as a rental or maybe some other type of rental property but I’ve gotten mixed responses from others when I tell them about it. Anyone have any arguments/suggestions for or against it? Any personal stories or experiences? I’ve seen some pretty scary rental stories out there that just sound like absolute nightmares. 
I’m sure there are some great suggestions out there and I look forward to hearing them. ",5,7,1733419796.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h7elwu/home_equity_from_a_paid_off_home/
Bitcoin isn't speculative and it solves the Byzantine General's problem.,"I don't know how technical I should get in this OP, but a lot of ""traditional investors"" are still too biased against bitcoin because they don't understand the technology. They are the same kind of people who said don't invest in AMZN because no body will want to buy books on these new fangled ""online stores"".

What is the Byzantine General's problem? It's probably one of those most valuable problems in human civilization, if we were to put monetary value on it. It is a problem where one person can't trust the others in a group. It's typically encountered in complex organizations or where technology requires fidelity (Ai).

So Bitcoin can both enforce fidelity and fault tolerance across the Ai spectrum and across human civilization.

The US DoD also publishes papers on another application of Bitcoin which is cryptography, which is why almost all of the global mining is expectedly split between China, Russia and US, each controlling about 30% share. Because the three super powers recognize that a bitcoin wrapper around data effectively puts a price tag on that data.

Lastly, how does the mining ""subsidy work""? Subsidy is pulled from the white paper, it's not a miner's reward, it's a subsidy.

The subsidy puts a price floor on Bitcoin by ensuring that transaction fees are not prohibitively expensive until bitcoin is large enough to make meaningful transactions.

If we think of the subsidy in terms of bitcoin only then when it first began the transaction fee was something like 50 bitcoin. Four halvings later and it went to 25, 12.5, 6.25 and now 3.125 bitcoin.

So it costs 3.125 bitcoin to transact right now, and is entirely subsidized. Think of transactions as a bank with limited teller windows and you auction aka bid the highest price for use of that teller window.

Transactions take place on the Lightning network and companies like AMZN are building their own Lightning networks which are basically like owning your own credit card company where you take a fee for the use of the credit card. So companies are already branching into this.

So let's recap the technology to see how it's not a speculation at all, it's the next Ai or Internet or etc.

1. It solves Byzantine General's problem solving one of the most valuable problems in human history by allowing Ai and organizations to have fidelity between systems.
2. It is a massive cryptographic engine that puts a price tag on the value of whatever is being protected. A hacker has to spend that much money to defeat the encryption.
3. It has aguaranted floor in price that is inverse-proportional to the cost of the transactions as measured in the Bitcoin subsidy given to miners. The fewer coin used in transaction cost at greater power usage (fiat cost) then the greater the fiat value of Bitcoin.
4. The Lightning network is the off-chain payment method that Bitcoin uses and that generates fees for the operators of the nodes and those fees are like credit card fees generating revenue for the operators of the ecosystem.

If you ever worried about investing in Bitcoin because it's a ""Gamble"", it's no more a gamble than investing in Coca-Cola or a power plant.",0,66,1733419303.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h7ees2/bitcoin_isnt_speculative_and_it_solves_the/
How do you decide what type of investor you are?,"I am 33m make about 85k a year - wife makes about the same. first year Roth IRA account which I maxed out with a few different ETF's. I've been trading though for about 4 years. Stocks and crypto. Currently YTD up 17% and all time 25%. I swing trade some, long trade some and rarely day trade. I guess my question is how does one put together a strategy on the type of investor they are? Do people usually switch their strategy with time? Is it ok to be a bit of everything? Thoughts? I guess my overall goal is to build wealth for me and my family and I am interested in passive income as well.

Should I Diversify my Roth IRA,"I previously had my Roth IRA set up with a financial advisor group and just never really paid attention to it which seems to be a pretty big no no because of fees and such.  

Moves it over into fidelity and someone recommended that I just toss it all in a Fidelity Index Fund because I’m very much a passive “set it and forget it” type of person when it comes to this stuff. I don’t follow the market and look at stocks or anything like that. 

Is it okay or advisable to have my entire Roth IRA and all future monthly contributions I make go into this 1 mutual index fund?  
(I know there’s a $7k annual limit). 

Should I be spreading it across different funds?
